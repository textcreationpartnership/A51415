            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of a Nervous Conſumption.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>A Nervous <hi>Atrophy,</hi> or Conſumption is a waſting of the Body without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Fever, Cough, or ſhortneſs of Breath; but it is attended with a want of Appetite, and a bad Digeſtion, upon which there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows a Languiſhing Weakneſs of Nature, and a falling away of the Fleſh every day more and more.<note place="margin">A Nervous Conſumption that which <hi>Virginians</hi> are moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to.</note> Which kind of Conſumption I have ſometimes obſerved in <hi>England,</hi> but moſt frequently amongſt thoſe that have lived in <hi>Virginia,</hi> after they have come over hither.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of this Diſeaſe the ſtate of the Body appears oedematous and blouted, and as it were ſtufft with diſpirited Chyle; the Face is pale and ſqualid, the Stomack loaths every thing but Liquids, the ſtrength of the Patient declines at that rate, that before the fleſhy Parts of the Body are evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd, he is render'd plainly feeble, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt always confin'd to his Bed. The Urine alſo keeps not conſtant to any colour, though for the moſt part it be high-colour'd, and but little in quantity. Yet it is ſometimes, (as it happens commonly to be in Nervous Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers) though ſeldom, pale and plentiful. But there is no conſiderable Fever to be diſcovered, either by the Pulſe, or a Thirſt, or Heat, how high-colour'd ſoever the Urine appears. So that the Pathognomonick Signs, or thoſe which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59580:7"/>
do evidently manifeſt the beginning of this Conſumption, are a decreaſe of the Patient's Strength, and a loſs of Appetite, without any remarkable Fever, Cough, or ſhortneſs of Breath, though in the Progreſs of the Diſtemper, when a Conſumption of the Fleſh has gradually af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the whole Habit of the Body, there is ſome difficulty and trouble in breathing to be obſerved, as it uſes to happen to all thoſe who are under a great Weakneſs.</p>
                  <p>The immediate cauſe of this Diſtemper I apprehend to be in the Syſtem of the Nerves proceeding from a Preternatural ſtate of the Animal Spirits,<note place="margin">The Cauſes.</note> and the deſtruction of the Tone of the Nerves; whereupon I have uſed to call this a Conſumption in the Habit of the Body. For as the Appetite and Concoction are overthrown by the weak and infirm Tone of the Stomack, ſo alſo the Aſſimilation, the Fermentation, and Volatilization of the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritious Juice are hindred in the whole Habit of the Body from the diſtemper'd ſtate of the Brain and Nerves.</p>
                  <p>The Cauſes which diſpoſe the Patient to this Diſeaſe, I have for the moſt part obſerved to be violent Paſſions of the Mind, the intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate drinking of Spirituous Liquors, and an unwholſom Air, by which it is no wonder if the Tone of the Nerves, and the Temper of the Spirits are deſtroy'd.</p>
                  <p>This Diſtemper as moſt other Nervous Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes is Chronical, but very hard to be cured,<note place="margin">The Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks.</note> unleſs a Phyſician be called at the beginning of it. At firſt it flatters and deceives the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, for which reaſon it happens for the moſt part that the Phyſician is conſulted too late. And at laſt it terminates in an Hydropical and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59580:8"/>
Oedematous ſwelling of the Body, eſpecially of the lower and depending Parts, in which caſe there remain no hopes of the Patient's Life, neither is there any thing more to be done for his Cure, than giving him ſome eaſe, whereby his Miſerable Life may be lengthened for ſome days.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Cure.</note>The buſineſs of Cure, if it be ſo that the help of our Art is called in in due time, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the convenient uſe of <hi>Stomack</hi>-Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, and ſuch as comfort and ſtrengthen the Nerves; ſuch are <hi>Chalybeates, Antiſcorbutick, Cephalick, and bitter Medicines</hi> of all ſorts. As for Example, let the Patient, if his Body be coſtive, take every third or fourth Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>four Ounces of the bitter Decoction with Senna,</hi> or every fourth Night <hi>two Ounces of the Sacred Tincture,</hi> or <hi>of our Sacred Cepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Tincture made with</hi> Hiera Picra <hi>infuſed in Rue-water, Black Cherry-water, and ſtrong Piony-water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For his common Drink, let him uſe Ale, in which a Bag of <hi>Cephalick and Antiſcorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Ingredients has been hung. An hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Dinner let him take xxx drops of <hi>Elixir Proprietatis</hi> in a draught of Wormwood-White-wine. To the Region of the Stomack let there be applyed the <hi>Magiſterial Stomack-Plaiſter, with ſome Drops of the Chymical Oyl of Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon and Oyl of Wormwood.</hi> Or let the Stomack be fomented every day with ſome Aromatick Bags made of the Leaves of <hi>Mint, Wormwood, Cinnamon, Mace, Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doary, Galingale, Cyprus-roots, Calamus Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticus boyl'd in Claret.</hi> If it be in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, let him uſe the <hi>Chalybeate Waters:</hi> But if it be the Winter time, let him make uſe of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59580:8"/>
a <hi>Chalybeate Syrup,</hi> or our <hi>Chalybeate and Aromatick Wine</hi> made <hi>with the Filings of Steel</hi> quenched three or four times in ſtrong White-Wine, and <hi>with Zedoary-roots, Galin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale, Nutmegs, the beſt Cinnamon, Mace, Cubebs, Cloves</hi> bruiſed, and ſteeped in the ſame Wine. But for Chalybeates, I do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>Mynſicht</hi>'s <hi>Extract</hi> before any other, which I order to be given for xx. or xxx. days in the form of a Bolus, or Pills. As for Example.</p>
                  <p>Take of <hi>Mynſicht</hi>'s <hi>Extract</hi> half a Scruple, <hi>Balm of Gilead</hi> (which in this caſe is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and beneficial, becauſe it is not a little grateful to the Stomack and Nerves) ſeven Drops, <hi>Old Conſerve of red Roſes</hi> a Dram, mix them, and make them up into a Bolus to be repeated every day. Or if the Patient chooſes to take Pills, let the Extract be made up into that form in the manner following. Take of <hi>Mynſicht</hi>'s <hi>Extract</hi> half a Scruple, of <hi>Balm of Gielead</hi> ſeven Drops, of <hi>Haly</hi>'s <hi>Pouder</hi> ſix Grains, of <hi>the compound Pouder of the Roots of Wake-Robin</hi> four Grains, of <hi>Pouder of Liquorice</hi> ſo much as will make them into the due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of Pills, and make the Maſs into Pills of a middle ſize, let them be gilded, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated once every day.</p>
                  <p>Alſo <hi>Natural Balſam</hi> by it ſelf, as likewiſe <hi>Spirit of Hartſhorn,</hi> and <hi>Spirit of Sal Armoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack</hi> are of uſe in this caſe, becauſe they are good for the Nerves. As for Example: Let the Patient take viij. or x. drops of <hi>Natural Balſam,</hi> or <hi>Spirit of Hartſhorn</hi> in a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent quantity of <hi>Sugar-candy</hi> twice a day.</p>

                     </note>Let the Patient endeavour to divert and make his Mind chearful by Exerciſe, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of his Friends.

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Duke</hi>'s Daughter in St. <hi>Mary Axe,</hi> in the Year 1684. and the Eighteenth Year of her Age, in the Month of <hi>July</hi> fell into a total ſuppreſſion of her Monthly Courſes from a multitude of Cares and Paſſions of her Mind, but without any Symptom of the Green-Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs following upon it. From which time her Appetite began to abate, and her Digeſtion to be bad; her Fleſh alſo began to be flaccid and looſe, and her looks pale, with other Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms uſual in an Univerſal Conſumption of the Habit of the Body, and by the extream and memorable cold Weather which happened the Winter following, this Conſumption did ſeem to be not a little improved; for that ſhe was wont by her ſtudying at Night, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual poring upon Books, to expoſe her ſelf both Day and Night to the injuries of the Air, which was at that time extreamly cold, not without ſome manifeſt Prejudice to the Syſtem of her Nerves. The Spring following, by the Preſcription of ſome Emperick, ſhe took <hi>a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59580:9"/>
Vomit,</hi> and after that I know not what <hi>Steel</hi> Medicines, but without any Advantage. So from that time loathing all ſorts of Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſhe wholly neglected the care of her ſelf for two full Years, till at laſt being brought to the laſt degree of a <hi>Maraſmus,</hi> or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and thereupon ſubject to frequent Fainting Fits, ſhe apply'd her ſelf to me for Advice.</p>

Only her Appetite was diminiſhed, and her Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion uneaſie, with Fainting Fits, which did frequently return upon her.

                     <p>The Son of the Reverend Miniſter Mr. <hi>Steele,</hi> my very good Friend, about the Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Year of his Age fell gradually into a total want of Appetite, occaſioned by his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying too hard, and the Paſſions of his Mind, and upon that into an Univerſal <hi>Atrophy,</hi> pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away more and more for the ſpace of two Years, without any Cough, Fever, or any other Symptom of any Diſtemper of his Lungs, or any other Entrail; as alſo without a Looſeneſs, or <hi>Diabetes,</hi> or any other ſign of a Colliquation, or Preternatural Evacuation. And therefore I judg'd this Conſumption to be Nervous, and to have its ſeat in the whole Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of the Body, and to ariſe from the Syſtem of Nerves being diſtemper'd. I began, and firſt attempted his Cure with the uſe of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcorbutick, Bitter,</hi> and <hi>Chalybeate</hi> Medicines, as well Natural as Artificial, but without any benefit; and therefore when I found that the former Method did not anſwer our Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I advis'd him to abandon his Studies, to go into the Country Air, and to uſe Riding, and a Milk Diet (and eſpecially to drink Aſſes Milk) for a long time. By the uſe of which he recover'd his Health in a great meaſure, though he is not yet perfectly freed from a Conſumptive ſtate; and what will be the event of this Method, does not yet plainly appear.</p>

                     <p>Of a Conſumption proceeding from ſome Evacuation.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>TO this ſort of Original Conſumption from the whole Habit of the Body belongs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo another kind of Conſumption (which I have often met with in my Practice) ariſing from the empoveriſhment of the Blood,<note place="margin">The loſs and want of Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritious Juice empoveriſhes the Blood, and cauſes a Conſumption.</note> occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the Preternatural ſubſtraction and loſs of the Nutritious Juice. Whereupon the whole Maſs of Blood being deprived of the Nutritious and Oily Juice, grows ſour and too hot, affording none or very little Nouriſhment to the Muſcular Parts; and thereupon there follows a Conſumption of the whole Body, and a Hectical heat fixed in the whole Habit of it, without any conſiderable Cough, or difficulty of Breathing, or any other remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able affection of the Lungs, at leaſt in the beginning of the Diſtemper. But it muſt be confeſt that in the Progreſs of it the Lungs ſeem to be in ſome meaſure affected,<note place="margin">At length the Lungs ſeem affected in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</note> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally where the Preternatural Evacuations, which are the cauſe of the Diſtemper, are ſtopt by Art without any correction or ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Maſs of Blood, by which means it might recover its Natural, Oily, Benign Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſuch as renders it fit for Nouriſhment. In which caſe there is no reaſon to wonder if the hot and ſharp <hi>Serum</hi> of the Blood conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59580:11"/>
paſſing, after the other Sluices of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are ſtopt, through the ſoft and glandulous ſubſtance of the Lungs, does at length ſtuff, inflame, yea, and at laſt exulcerate them too; whereby it comes to paſs, that this Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was Originally in the Habit of the Body, does a little before Death end in a Conſumption of the Lungs, with a Cough, difficulty of Breathing, and other Pathogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monick Signs of that Diſtemper. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have often obſerved, that if the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite and Digeſtion are not reſtored by ſuch Medicines as have a peculiar quality of alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Blood, and ſtrengthening the Stomack, ſo that the Maſs of Blood may thereupon be ſupplyed and filled with a ſweet and Oily Juice, the Conſumption is not cured,<note place="margin">This Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſometimes turns to a Conſumption of the Lungs.</note> but at length is changed from a Conſumption in the Habit of the Body, to a Fatal Conſumption of the Lungs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is akin to that which is Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous.</note>And this Conſumption is in truth a-kin to the Nervous Conſumption, which I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned. For as in that, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a Preternatural ſtate of the Nervous Juice and Spirits, the Nutritious Chyle, which is continually carryed into the Blood, is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred leſs fit for the Nouriſhment of the Parts, and thereupon as the Maſs of Blood is filled with ſtale and diſpirited Chyle, ſuch as is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for Nouriſhment, and not craving any new, there follows a loſs of Appetite, and a ſickneſs in the Stomack, and conſequently a Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the whole Body, and at length a fixed Hectical and Colliquative heat in the ſolid Parts from the heat of the Blood and Spirits: So in this kind of Conſumption the Nutritious Juice running off from the Maſs of Blood with a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59580:11"/>
full ſtream, the Muſcular Parts of the Body being thus deprived of their due Nouriſhment, fall into an <hi>Atrophy;</hi> whereupon likewiſe the Maſs of Blood which remains, for want of new Oily Chyle is not only diſpirited, and rendred unfit for Nouriſhment, but a preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, fixed, and hectical heat is kindled not only in the Blood, but alſo in the Spirits, and all the ſolid Parts; whereupon there follows a Drought and want of Appetite. Which kind of Conſumption is that, which we are now in the firſt place profeſſedly to treat of.<note place="margin">The Cure of this Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption is to be altered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion varies.</note> But becauſe the Cure of this kind of Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be altered according to the variety of the Evacuations, which are the cauſe of it, I ſhall add nothing concerning the general Cure of it, but refer that to the ſeveral kinds of Evacuations, which are the cauſe of this Diſtemper, to be ſpoken of under their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Heads.

                  <p>THat which here firſt offers it ſelf, is a Conſumption from Bleeding, whether it be at the Noſe, or from the Lungs by cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from the Throat by hawking, from the Stomack by vomiting, from the Kidneys by the paſſages of Urine, from the Haemorrhoids, or Veſſels of the Womb in the ordinary Monthly Purgations, or difficult Labour, or laſtly, from Wounds, where there happens a plentiful and long flux of Blood from the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the large Blood-Veſſels.<note place="margin">Moderate and frequent bleeding makes People grow fat.</note> For although frequent and moderate Blood-letting (as every ignorant Fellow and Barber knows) will make one grow fat; foraſmuch as the emptying the Veſſels with a moderate hand does make room for a greater quantity of new Chyle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Maſs of Blood growing richer, is rendred more fit for Nouriſhment, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Appetite is excited:<note place="margin">But an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate bleeding im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhes the blood, and cauſes a Conſumption.</note> Yet every immoderate and long Bleeding impoveriſhes the Blood, and creates a Hectical heat in the Spirits and ſolid Parts, thereupon deſtroying the Appetite, and bringing the whole Body into a Conſumption and Leanneſs.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THIS Conſumption ſeems to have been known even to the Ancients,<note place="margin">This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption was not unknown to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients.</note> under the name of a Conſumption of the Back, when it proceeds from a <hi>Gonorrhoea.

                  <p>'Tis very true indeed that a <hi>Gonorrhoea,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A Venereal Gonorrhoea and Whites often end in a Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lungs.</note> and the Whites, that are of an ill Nature, and <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real,</hi> (when the Impurity proceeding from that Venom has once infected the Humors) do often terminate in a Conſumption of the Lungs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they are timely and perfectly cur'd. But of this kind of Conſumption, and of the Cauſes, Degrees, and Cure of it, I ſhall Diſcourſe more fully in its proper place, to wit, in the latter part of this Treatiſe, when I ſhall profeſſedly ſpeak of a Symptomatical Conſumption of the Lungs. But for the preſent I do from a long Experience and Obſervation affirm, that a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption does often ariſe from a ſimple or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> and Whites,<note place="margin">A Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times proceed from a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Gonor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoea, &amp;c.</note> and therefore this ſort ariſing from the continual ſubſtraction of the Nutritious Juice by the Seminal Glands, muſt be reckoned under the Head of an Originary
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59580:15"/>
Conſumption. For in a <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> and the Whites, ſometimes the Flux is ſo extraordinary, and continues ſo long, that the Maſs is thereby plainly diſpirited, and rendred unfit for Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereupon the Blood being loaded with Heterogeneous and diſagreeable Particles, grows hot, and at length a Hectick Diſpoſition is by degrees brought upon the ſolid Parts and the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of the Body, which is the ſame ſort of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption that we are now treating of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The preſaging ſigns of this Conſumption.</note>The Symptoms which preſage this Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I have for the moſt part obſerved to be theſe, to wit, an <hi>Hypochondriacal</hi> Oppreſſion, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, and too much Thoughtfulneſs, with a decay of Strength, and loſs of Appetite in Men that are affected with a plentiful Running of the Reins; but in Women that have been long afflicted with the Whites flowing in a great quantity, a ſoft and blouted Habit of the Body, a ſqualid and pale Countenance, together with <hi>Hyſterical</hi> Fits, a remarkable Wearineſs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of Strength; all which Symptoms proceed from the ſame cauſe, to wit, from the poor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirited Nature of the Blood, cauſed by a want of new Chyle, whereby not only the Spirits are weakned and oppreſt, but alſo the Habit of the Body is rendred <hi>Oedematous</hi> from the wateriſh diſpoſition of the Blood, as it is full of old and diſpirited Chyle. And therefore the Signs which preſage this Conſumption are, as I ſaid before, <hi>Hypochondriacal</hi> Oppreſſions, <hi>Hyſterical</hi> Affections, a decay and want of Strength, a blouted habit of the Body, and a want of Appetite. Which Symptoms in progreſs of time, that is, when the Diſtemper comes to be confirm'd, are followed alſo by ſome others, as a Thirſt, a <hi>Hectical</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, <hi>Atrophy,</hi> and waſting of the Fleſh, till
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59580:15"/>
at length the Body is plainly brought to the higheſt degree of a Conſumption, and that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often without any Cough, or any other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable ſign of a Conſumption of the Lungs.</p>
                  <p>This Diſtemper is eaſily cured, if the antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent cauſe of it can be removed, that is, if the <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> and Whites can be cured.<note place="margin">When confi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And therefore a Prudent and Honeſt Phyſician, that is carefully concern'd for his own Reputation, will not do well to undertake the Cure of it, but ought rather to take his leave, and walk off from ſuch a Patient, after he has made a Prognoſtick of his Death; and ſo he will be juſt to his Art, and may ſatisfie his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, though he loſes ſome Fees, and defrauds his own Pocket.</p>
                  <p>But if the Phyſician be ſent for in time,<note place="margin">What a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician is to do in the Cure of it, when he is ſent for in time.</note> he ought to do all he can by all proper means, and a convenient Method to ſtop the <hi>Gonorrhoea,</hi> or Whites, which are the cauſe of this Conſumption. Which thing we ſhall ſpeak of at ſome other time, and ſhew how it is to be done in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a <hi>Gonorrhoea,</hi> and of the Whites. This efflux of the Nutritious Juice being once ſtopt by Art, we muſt endeavour with all our Power to repleniſh the diſpirited and impoveriſht Blood as ſoon as may be, with new, oily, and benign Chyle.

                     <p>Of a Conſumption proceeding from <hi>Apoſtemes</hi> and large <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>I Have always obſerved that <hi>Apoſtemes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Large <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers in any part may cauſe a Conſumption.</note> and large Ulcers, let them happen to any part whatſoever of the Body (whether external or internal) if they continue long, and throw out much <hi>Serum,</hi> or wateriſh Matter, have at length rendred the Body of the Patient Conſumptive, and that even to the degree of a Fatal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; and I can ſay, I have taken notice that theſe kind of Ulcers do bring on a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption as well when they are in the Muſcles of the Back, and in the Teſticles, yea, in the Knee and the Foot, as when they are in the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, or Liver, or in the Lungs themſelves. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, I have often obſerved that a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the Lungs has come upon theſe large and old Ulcers.</p>
                  <p>The cauſe of this Conſumption without all queſtion is the long and plentiful ſubſtraction of the Nutritious Juice continually flowing out of the Maſs of Blood by the Ulcers;<note place="margin">The reaſon of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</note> whereby the Blood, which remains in the Veſſels being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of its Oily, Nutritious Juice, does grow ſour, and contracts a Preternatural heat, and is thereupon rendred unfit for the Nouriſhment of the Body; whereupon a Feveriſh and Hectical heat not only is kindled in the Blood and Spirits, but alſo remains fixed in the Habit of the Body, and the ſolid Parts, together with a Thirſt, a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59580:17"/>
decay of Strength, want of Appetite, ſickneſs of the Stomack, an <hi>Atrophy</hi> of the Parts, and at length a want of Sleep, Light-headedneſs, and the other ſigns of a Fever, until the ſick Perſon, being brought into the ſtate of a <hi>Maraſmus,</hi> or conſummate Conſumption, does miſerably end his days, though for the moſt part without a difficulty of Breathing, Cough, or any other <hi>Pathognomonick</hi> ſign of a Conſumption of the Lungs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption may be coſtly cur'd, if the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers are heal'd in time.</note>This Conſumption (as we have obſerved of that in the foregoing Chapter) does eaſily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of a Cure, if it be ſo that the Ulcers, which are the cauſe of it, can be timely cured by the internal help of Phyſick, and the external Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of Surgery, that is, before the Patient is fallen into any degree of a <hi>Maraſmus.</hi> But (alas!) the Patient too often in this caſe being deceived by the fair Promiſes and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome ill Surgeons, does not ſend for the <hi>Phyſician,</hi> till ſuch time as it is more proper to have the good Counſel of ſome <hi>Divine</hi> about the future ſtate of his Soul, or the Advice of a <hi>Lawyer</hi> about making his Will.</p>

To which end a plentiful uſe of the <hi>Decoction</hi> of <hi>Sarſa,</hi> &amp;c. is of great uſe, not
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59580:17"/>
only to give a ſoftneſs to the Blood, that the Blood being freed from its ſharpneſs and preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Heat, may be able more eaſily to aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milate to it ſelf the freſh Chyle, and to change it into its own Nature, and that the efflux and loſs of the Chyle by the Ulcers may be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, which does much promote the Cure of the Ulcers; for which reaſon without doubt theſe <hi>Decoctions</hi> are commonly called drying; but alſo to carry off that load of diſpirited, and unprofitable Juices, which lurk in the Habit of the Body, and in the Veſſels, by the pores of the Skin in ſweats, and inſenſible Breathings. It has been my Practice to uſe the following De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction.</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>of the beſt Sarſaparilla ſliced ſix Ounces,</hi>

loſs of the Chyle, which indeed does very often happen. For this paſſage, by which the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritious Juice uſes to run off, being now ſtopt by the Surgeons and Phyſicians Art, if the Blood ſtill remains diſpirited, and does not recover its former Balſamick and Oily Nature, it is wont to grow more hot and ſharp, and thereupon that ſharp and hot Nutritious Juice (which was uſed before to be thrown out by the Ulcer) it uſually comes now to caſt off upon the ſubſtance of the Lungs, as being ſpungy, and apt to receive the Humours. Whereupon follows not only a ſtuffing of the Lungs, and upon that a difficulty of Breathing; but alſo a conſiderable ſwelling of the Glands, which do often enough happen in theſe parts, and upon that a dry and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Cough, yea, a Heat and Inflammation, and thereupon a Fever, not only a Hectical one, but alſo a Putrid, or rather Inflammatory Fever, and at length an <hi>Apoſtem,</hi> and Ulcers, with a Thirſt, and want of Appetite; all which do at laſt end in a fatal and confirm'd Conſumption of the Lungs.<note place="margin">The Signs which threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it must be attended to.</note> And therefore as ſoon as ever theſe external and remote Ulcers begin to heal, the Phyſician ought to make what Obſervation he can, to find whether the leaſt degree of a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of Breathing, or any other ſign of an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Lungs comes upon it. Yea, if the Appetite continues weak, or if but the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of a Preternatural Heat in the Habit of the Body does appear,<note place="margin">If they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, what is to be done.</note> which may give us the leaſt occaſion to ſuſpect a Conſumption of the Lungs, the firſt Attack and Progreſs of it ought to be prevented with all the Phyſician's Power, in the manner following. Let ſeveral Iſſues be made, the Head ſhaved, the uſe of the Balſamick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies before mentioned, and the <hi>Sarſa</hi> Drink,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59580:19"/>
with the aforeſaid Vulnerary Herbs be continued; or for the farther temperating and altering of the Blood, let the Patient be put into a Milk Diet, and kept ſtrictly to it. For the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the <hi>Chalybeate</hi> Mineral Waters are here alſo of great uſe. Alſo the Phyſician muſt make all the haſt he can, and disburden the Lungs that are ſtufft, by Pectoral and Pulmonary <hi>Apozems,</hi> expectorating <hi>Linctuſes,</hi> and other Medicines of that Nature, which we ſhall afterwards deſcribe in the Book of a Conſumption of the Lungs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Tone of the Parts is injured, and a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh heat is brought on by the continual ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of hot and ſharp Juices.</p>
                  <p>Let the Patient alſo have a very great care to preſerve himſelf from Paſſions of his Mind,<note place="margin">Paſſions of the Mind, Cold, and violent Excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe are to be avoided.</note> and Cold, and uſe no violent Exerciſes; let him alſo abſtain from the uſe of Wine, and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Liquors, which may make the motion of the Blood to and through the Lungs quicker than it ought to be, and kindle a Preternatural heat in the Blood.</p>
                  <p>But if there be no ſuſpicion of the Lungs,<note place="margin">What is to be done after the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers are healed, when there is no ſuſpicion of the Lungs.</note> when the Ulcer comes to be healed, let the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient be enjoyn'd to be chearful, let him be plac'd in a benign and open Air, and eat plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully of ſuch Food as affords a good Juice, but yet is mild, and free from a ſharpneſs; and laſtly, let him uſe moderate Exerciſe, by the uſe of all which the Blood may as ſoon as is poſſible recover its former Balſamick, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and Oily Nature, and the Appetite of the Stomack may be increaſed.</p>
                  <p>By which Method we may not only prevent a Conſumption that is coming, but alſo cure one that is begun, when it proceeds from external Ulcers, as I have before diſcours'd more largely

And therefore if by reaſon of the want of an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite there be more Nutritious Juice ſuckt out of the Blood through the Breaſts for a long time, than is ſupplyed to the Maſs of Blood by the new Chyle from the Lacteal Veſſels,<note place="margin">When, and how the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Suck does cauſe a Conſumption.</note> it is in, poſſible but an impoveriſhment of the Blood ſhould follow, and thereupon an <hi>Atrophy</hi> of the Body (ſeeing it is depriv'd of due Nouriſhment) and conſequently an Hectical heat in the Blood, Spirits, and Habit of the Body, which is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of Original Conſumption proceeding from the ſubſtraction of the Nutritious Juice; of which we ſhall now treat.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Yet a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is ſometimes cured by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Suck.</note>Yet I muſt ingeniouſly declare, that I have ſometimes obſerved a Conſumptive Diſpoſition cured by giving of Suck, and that not only in my moſt dear Wife, but alſo in very many other Women. As for Example: My Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Mrs. <hi>Wilſon,</hi> who at other times is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive, and goes up and down like a Ghoſt, does always grow fat all the time ſhe gives Suck.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59580:21"/>
of her Body, and upon that into a Conſumption of her Lungs from the ſudden weaning of her Child. But at the ſame time it is as obvious to our Obſervation, that all ſuch Nurſes as grow fat in this manner from giving of Suck,<note place="margin">But ſuch Nurſes have always a good Stomack.</note> have a good Stomack, yea, that during the time of their giving of Suck their Appetite is very much increaſed, and from thence it is very eaſie to give an Account for this appearance; to wit, that the Appetite being increaſed by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual drawing off of the Nutritious Juice by the Child's Sucking, there is room made for a greater quantity of new and oily Chyle, by which the Blood is every day enrich'd, which does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce more to the Cure of a Conſumptive Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition than all the Medicines in the World. But if the Appetite during the time of giving Suck grows languid, and thereupon by reaſon of the little Food that is taken in, a leſs quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of new Juice is ſupplyed to the Blood, than is carried off by the Breaſts, a Hectical Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in the Blood and Spirits muſt inevitably follow; and an <hi>Atrophy,</hi> or Conſumption in the Habit of the Body, and that for the Reaſons which we have juſt now given.</p>

                     <p>The Wife of Mr. <hi>Bird</hi> my very good Friend, who lives in <hi>Fetter-Lane,</hi> being about three and thirty Years old, gave Suck to a luſty Boy for the ſpace of a Year, or more.

                  <p>MANY times in a Scorbutical Diſpoſition of the Body,<note place="margin">A ſharpneſs of the Blood often ariſes from the Scurvy.</note> the Blood grows ſharp to that degree, that being diſturbed upon every little occaſion, it cannot aſſimilate the new Chyle to it ſelf; whereby it comes to paſs that it is thrown out by the Glands of the Inteſtines in a continual flux like a ſtream.

                     <head>A Hiſtory.</head>
                     <p>The Son of <hi>Thomas Lechmere,</hi> 
                        <abbr>Eſq</abbr> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two Years, and breeding of his Teeth, fell into an Inflammation of his Lungs upon taking of cold, and was treated very ill by an Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary, who had omitted Bleeding, and other things, that were very requiſite to a true and skilful Method of Cure. But at length I and my Famous Colleague Dr. <hi>Croen,</hi> though we were called in late, recovered him in ſome meaſure, by taking away ſome Blood, and the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Bliſters, and Liniments, that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for his Breaſt, as alſo by giving inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch Medicines as were proper for his Lungs: But yet he continued ſickly with a Cough and difficulty of Breathing, for the ſpace of a Twelve Month at leaſt, from which time the poor Child began to be ſeized with a Hectick Fever, which intermitted every day, which although it was ſeveral times taken off with the <hi>Peruvian Bark,</hi> yet ſoon return'd again, and indeed came upon him by uncertain intervals for a whole Year, even to his dying day. But at the very beginning of the Fever his Belly began to be diſtended with a Dropſical ſwelling, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed ſtrangely every day; his Cough and ſhortneſs of Breath at the ſame time growing worſe: All which Symptoms were at length ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with an <hi>Atrophy</hi> of the Parts, even to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59580:29"/>
the degree of a <hi>Maraſmus.</hi> But yet when his Body was a perfect <hi>Skeleton,</hi> and the <hi>Dropſie</hi> at a high Tide (which was very remarkable) he had a brisk and healthful look, and a lovely Countenance, without the leaſt Tincture of a Yellowneſs, and a good, or rather greedy Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and that to the very day he dyed. From whence I did rightly conjecture, and always told his Friends, as my Opinion, that his Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie was truly Chylous, cauſed by the Chyle flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the cavity of the Belly by the Lacteal Veſſels, which were broke by ſome Accident, and that the Conſumption which accompanied it was not a true Conſumption of the Lungs, but ſuch as proceeded merely from an inanition, that is, the draining of the due Nutritious Juice out of the Lacteal Veſſels, upon ſome rupture that had been made in them; which appeared very plainly from the Event. For in Tapping of the Child's Belly, whilſt he was yet alive, we took out ſeveral Pints of Milky Chyle, and very ſweet, ſuch as is found in the Duct it ſelf, which conveys the Chyle. But when we opened the Body after he was dead, we found for all the difficulty of Breathing, and long Cough he had had, the Lungs themſelves ſound, without any Diſtemper, but only that in the hinder part near the Wind-Pipe there appeared a great many Glands, and thoſe pretty large and hard, which made a hard and very conſiderable preſſure up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Chyle-duct it ſelf, almoſt in that Part where it arrives at the <hi>Subclavian Vein;</hi> and they were of ſo great a weight and bulk, that it ſeemed very difficult, if not plainly impoſſible for the Chyle to paſs into the Blood by reaſon of the preſſure they had made upon the Duct, which had ſtraightned it, as if it had been tied
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59580:29"/>
with a ſtring. And thereupon without doubt it came to paſs that the tender and thin Lacteal Veſſels which are in the Belly (the Chyle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually preſſing, and not finding a free paſſage above by the Chyle-duct) being diſtended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their Tone, did at length break, and ſo threw the Chyle, which was deſign'd for the reparation of the Blood, as it were in a continued ſtream into the cavity of the Belly. From what I have now ſaid, it is plain almoſt to a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, firſt, that theſe <hi>Tubercles,</hi> or tumify'd Glands of the Lungs did at firſt proceed from the ill Method of Curing the Inflammation of his Lungs, that is, for want of timely Bleeding and Expectoration. Secondly, that as the trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and dry Cough was cauſed by the conſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Veſſels of the Lungs, which convey the Air, by theſe ſwellings, ſo the difficulty of Breathing proceeded from the preſſure of the extravaſated Chyle below the Midriff. Thirdly, that this Conſumption was not a true Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lungs; becauſe tho' there were <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bercles</hi> or Swellings in the Lungs, yet they were not like <hi>Apoſtemes,</hi> nor Ulcerated. But this deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Conſumption did really proceed from that <hi>Chylous</hi> Dropſie, upon which that Nutritious Juice, which ought to have been employ'd for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the Blood, and the Nutrition of the Parts, was continually ſubſtracted, and carried another way. Fourthly, that this <hi>Dropſie</hi> did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a rupture of the ſmall Lacteal Veſſels that are in the Belly; and laſtly, that this rupture of the ſmall Lacteal Veſſels was cauſed by that continual preſſure, which the ſwellings in the Lungs had made upon the upper part of the Chyle-duct.</p>

                  <p>I have a mind to add here to the end of this Chapter an Inſtance or two of this Nature, by the relating of which, the cure of this Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be ſhewn ſo far as I have obſerved, and am able to give an Account of it.</p>

But above all he was wont to complain of Colliqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Sweats, that followed him continually both Night and Day, and that as well in the Winter as the Summer time. From whence it came to paſs, that not only he was very ſubject to take cold, upon which he always felt great pains in his Nervous Parts, but alſo his whole Body wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted ſo, that he was juſtly to be reckoned in the number of thoſe that were in a Conſumption.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59580:31"/>
However with Iſſues made between his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and the uſe of a Diet-drink made with Antiſcorbutick Ingredients ſteep'd in Ale for his ordinary Drink, and eſpecially the long uſe of the Mineral Waters, both the <hi>Chalybeate</hi> and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, which he took as well in the Winter as the Summer, he was perfectly freed not only from thoſe other Diſtempers which affected his Nerves, but alſo from theſe Colliquative Sweats: By which means it came to paſs, that he lived ſeveral Years in the latter end of his Old Age with a ſtrong Habit of Body, an uninterrupted Health, a chearful Mind, a freſh and brisk Look, as if he began to grow Young again.</p>

To whom beſides the outward application of an Anodyne Liniment, I gave a Draught, that might put her into a breathing ſweat, Of <hi>Carduus-water, Treacle-water, Venice-Treacle, and the Syrup of Meconium;</hi> upon which it happen'd that ſhe fell and diſſolv'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to moſt profuſe and very ſtinking Sweats, which though they took ſome of the Bed-cloaths off from her by degrees, did nevertheleſs continue for a fortnight or more, with an extraordinary decay of her Strength, and a pining Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her Body. Which when I obſerved, I forthwith preſcrib'd ſuch Electuaries and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Juleps as were binding, and proper to ſtop the pores of the Skin, and other things of that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59580:31"/>
Nature; whereupon her Sweats preſently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd, but although the pores of the Skin were then ſtopt by Art, yet the new Chyle, which by reaſon of the Acrimony that remain'd in the Blood, was not ſo well aſſimilated and united to that Maſs which remain'd, being mixt with it, the freſh Nutritious Juice attempted to find out a new way, and to diſcharge it ſelf by Stool, and ſo in the room of her Colliquative Sweats there ſucceeded a Looſeneſs that was as Colliquative as they were, together with griping pains, the Habit of her Body every day running farther into a Conſumption.</p>
                     <p>But this Door being in like manner barrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doed with the uſe of Opiates and Emplaſtick Medicines, the Nutritious Juice found out ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Kidneys, whereupon the poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man fell into a <hi>Diabetes,</hi> which ſtill promoted her Conſumption, almoſt to the degree of a <hi>Maraſmus.</hi>

                  <p>THIS general Conſumption proceeding from Evacuations does often depend upon other Diſtempers;<note place="margin">This Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption from Evacuations often depends upon other Diſtempers, as, A Lientery.</note> and therefore it may juſtly be called a general Symptomatical Conſumption. As firſt, upon a <hi>Lientery,</hi> to wit, when the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the Stomack, which makes the Chyle, is injured by a Preternatural diſpoſition of the Spittle, and the ill Temper of the Nervous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor: Whereby it comes to paſs, that the Blood and Habit of the Body (ſince the Food that is taken is carried down through the Guts, and comes away as it went in without any alteration) cannot receive any Recruits from the Food; and from hence there neceſſarily follows an <hi>Atrophy</hi> cauſed by Inanition.</p>
                  <p>Many times this general Conſumption pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a Preternatural alteration,<note place="margin">The Celiack Paſſion.</note> or obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Gall and Pancreatick Juice, or elſe of the Juice, which is naturally, and uſes to be ſeparated by the ſmall Glands, planted through the whole Pipe or Duct of the Inteſtines, and which ſerves for the ſeparation of the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious parts of the Food from thoſe, which are for Nouriſhment. For from hence it comes to paſs, that the Chylous parts of the Food, that goes down out of the Stomack, ſlipping by the ſmall mouths of the Milky Veſſels, are thruſt out together with the dreggy Excrements by Siege; and that either in white Stools, and ſuch as are plainly Chylous from the defect, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural diſpoſition of the Choler, (which is
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59580:33"/>
the proper Liquor for ſeparating the Chyle) as it commonly happens in the Jaundice, together with a great weakneſs of the Body, and waſting of the Fleſh: Or elſe in yellow Stools, as in the <hi>Celiack Paſſion,</hi> which either is from an Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Pancreatick Juice, and that which is ſeparated by the Glands of the Inteſtines, or uſes to happen from the depravation of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of thoſe Juices. In the firſt caſe the Urine is much tinged with a Yellow, or Jaundice co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, but in the latter it is quite contrary. In both of them, the Chyle not being ſeparated from the Excrementitious parts of the Food, the Blood is depriv'd of its due recruits, upon which I have often obſerved that an <hi>Atrophy,</hi> or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and that no lingring one, has ſeized the ſick Perſons.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Scrophulous Glands in the Meſentery</note>Finally, this general Symptomatical Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſometimes cauſed by many and large Scrophulous Kernels preternaturally ſituated in the Meſentery, by which (the Milky Veins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtraightned as with a Thread, or being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt) the paſſage of the Nutritious Liquor, which is ſeparated in the Inteſtines, and taken in by the mouths of the Lacteal Veins into the Maſs of Blood, is either totally, or in part hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. In which caſe the Stools are large, and Chylous, the Belly grows hard, and is ſwell'd, but the Urine flows in a very little quantity, yet keeps its Natural colour. Thereupon, the Blood not being every day repleniſhed with new Chyle, the Muſcular Parts are deprived of their due Nouriſhment, and daily pine away, and at length are waſted to the degree of a <hi>Maraſmus,</hi> though the Appetite at the ſame time be greedy, and the Patient continues almoſt always free from any thing of a Fever; an Inſtance of

                     <p>I ordered the <hi>Plaiſter Diaſaponis to be apply'd to his whole Belly, and the following Julep to be given him plentifully, and frequently.

                     <p>His Stools alſo were frequent, and chylous, his Urine little, but of a Natural colour; he had no Cough, breath'd freely enough, but he had a very Melancholick and plainly dead Look, and his Countenance was ſqualid and pale.</p>
                     <p>I ordered him the <hi>White Drink,</hi> and <hi>a Bolus with Diaſcordium, and torrefied Rhubarb, of each half a Scruple,</hi> to be taken once a Week; the <hi>Plaiſter Diaſaponis</hi> to be apply'd to his Belly, and the <hi>Julep</hi> I juſt now mentioned in the laſt Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59580:34"/>
which was made very ſtrong of the <hi>Salt of Amber,</hi> to be drank as often as he would take it.</p>
                     <p>What I have been telling of the former Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, the ſame thing did happily fall out here in this. For the Boy refuſing all other Liquors, did covet the Julep Day and Night, ſo that he drank almoſt four and twenty Ounces every day. By which means it came to paſs, that in the ſpace of a fortnight or leſs his Stools were brought to a Natural conſiſtence, colour, and quantity. His Urine alſo flow'd plentifully. The ſwelling of his Belly went down to a Miracle. Neither could I any more perceive any Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings that lay conceal'd within it, though I ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examin'd with my fingers. His Appetite and deſire of Drink were Natural, and as they ought to be. His Fleſh likewiſe ſeem'd gradually to increaſe every day. And now his Melancholy and Wearineſs being overcome, the Boy ſeems to recover not only the wonted vigour and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of his Body, but alſo a good Look, and a freſh Colour in ſome meaſure; ſo that I am not at all ſollicitous about what remains to compleat the Cure.</p>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The general cauſe of a Conſumption.</note>THE cauſe of a Conſumption of the Lungs in general is a vitiated diſpoſition of the Maſs of Blood, and of the Spirits in the Nerves, contracted gradually from ſeveral Procatartick or prediſpoſing cauſes, in which the ſharp or Malignant <hi>Serum</hi> or Water of the Blood being ſeparated by the ſoft and Glandulous ſubſtance of the Lungs, does ſtuff, inflame, and at length alſo exulcerate the Lungs themſelves, which is the immediate cauſe of this Diſtemper.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Proca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarctick cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. First, the ſtopping of Evacuations.</note>The Procatartick cauſes, or thoſe which give the firſt occaſion to this Diſeaſe, are, Firſt, the ſtopping of ſome uſual and neceſſary Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as the Monthly Courſes, Child-bed Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Old Sores, and eſpecially Fiſtula's, Iſſues, Sweating in the ſoles of the Feet, or any other parts of the Body, a <hi>Gonorrhoea,</hi> the Whites, and other Evacuations of that kind, when they are ſtopt without correcting or removing the cauſes upon which they depend: From whence it comes to paſs that even the Blood it ſelf is pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted and diſtemper'd by thoſe Humours, which are condemned by Nature to be thrown off, or baniſht, but by ſome Bars and Impediments lying in their way are ſtopt, and retain'd in the Maſs of Blood longer than is convenient.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>2.</hi> Paſſions of the Mind.</note> Secondly, troubleſome Paſſions of the Mind, but eſpecially
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59580:36"/>
Fear, Grief, Anger, too much Thinking, and Sollicitude, as alſo unſeaſonable and too long Studies, with other things of this Nature; which contribute very much to this Diſtemper, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by vitiating the Animal Spirits, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon hindring the Natural Fermentation of the Blood, but alſo by fixing almoſt a continual Spaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modick Contraction, or Convulſion upon the ſoft ſubſtance of the Lungs. Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>3.</hi> Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking.</note> a too plentiful, and an unſeaſonable gorging of Meat and Drink, and alſo an imprudent choice of ſuch Meats and Liquors, as abound with Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious parts, and are not very eaſie to be digeſted; but eſpecially the drinking too much Wine, and Liquors that are very Spirituous. Which when it is joyn'd with Cares and Grief, and other ſuch-like Paſſions of the Mind (ſo far as I have been able to obſerve) is commonly the cauſe of a Conſumption of the Lungs. For the Habit of the Body being from hence filled with a load of diſpirited and unprofitable Humours, as it is, when it is <hi>Oedematous,</hi> the whole Maſs of Blood is polluted, and rendred wateriſh and ſharp, and at length is diſpoſed to a Hectical heat. Fourthly, the neglect of due Exerciſe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>4.</hi> Want of due Exerciſe.</note> for want of which the Excrements, which ought by the uſual Law of Nature to be thrown out by the Skin, being detained in the Blood, are wont by degrees to deſtroy the <hi>Croſis</hi> or mixture of it. For want of this the Humours alſo are wont to ſtagnate in the Habit of the Body, and various Obſtructions to ariſe here and there in the ſmall Fibres themſelves; which contribute very much to the corrupting of the Blood, and the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Spirits. Fifthly, Night-ſtudies,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>5.</hi> Night Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and long Watchings.</note> and long Watchings, which not only weaken the Animal Spirits, which are neceſſary for the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59580:37"/>
Fermentation of the Blood, but alſo keep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Body thoſe Excrementitious parts, which are wont to be thrown out in the Bed by Sweat, or Perſpiration; and who will think it ſtrange, that the whole Maſs is by degrees vitiated by this means?<note place="margin">Sleeping in the day.</note> To this we may alſo add ſleeping in the Day, and ſleeping much, but eſpecially pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after eating, which as it diſpirits the Maſs of Blood, and fills it with uſeleſs Chyle by hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the Digeſtion of the Food (from which cauſe frequent and troubleſome Coughs are wont to proceed:) So by putting the Animal Spirits to ſleep at an unſeaſonable time, and thereupon hindring the Fermentation and Volatilization of the new Chyle, it makes the whole Maſs of Blood too wateriſh and ſharp.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>6.</hi> An ill Air.</note> Sixthly, alſo a foggy and thick Air, and that which is filled with the ſmoak of Coals, does extreamly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a Conſumption by vitiating the Animal Spirits, which are ſo neceſſary to the Natural Fermentation of the Blood; and alſo by ſtuffing and weakning the Lungs, that ſerve for Reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which are the Seat and Theatre of this Diſtemper.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>7.</hi> An Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</note> Seventhly, An Hereditary Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition from the Parents does very often bring a Conſumption of the Lungs, when every Body knows very well, that thoſe who come of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive Parents, are apt to fall into the ſame Diſtemper.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>8.</hi> An ill formation of the Breast.</note> Eighthly, an ill formation of the Breaſt, whether it be Natural or Accidental, is another cauſe of this Diſeaſe. I call that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, where the Breaſt is narrow, the Neck long, and the Shoulder-blades ſtand out like Wings: And that I call Accidental, where there is a crookedneſs, or diſtortion of the Breaſt, whereby not only the parts of the Breaſt, and eſpecially the Lungs being once weakned in their
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59580:37"/>
Tone, are rendred ſubject to the Flux of Rheumes; but alſo the Lungs wanting their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary expanſion, and being ſtreightned, do heap up in themſelves, and retain the vitiated <hi>Serum</hi> of the Blood, from whence it comes to paſs, that at length they come to have Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. Ninthly,<note place="margin">9. <hi>Infection.</hi>
                     </note> This Diſeaſe is alſo propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Infection. For this Diſtemper (as I have obſerved by frequent Experience) like a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious Fever does infect thoſe that lye with the Sick Perſon with a certain taint. Tenthly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>10.</hi> Chalky ſtones, and ſuch like in the Lungs,</note> alſo Chalky Stones, that are Preternaturally bred in the Lungs; or Nails, and other hard Bodies ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping down into the Lungs, when Perſons laugh, are to be reckoned among the Cauſes of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the Lungs. By which not only a troubleſome Cough, provoking a Flux of the Humours is cauſed, but alſo Apoſtemes and Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, where alſo for the moſt part a ſpitting of Blood preceding does diſpoſe the Lungs to thoſe Apoſtemes and Ulcers. Of which I ſhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards give ſome Hiſtories. Eleventhly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>11.</hi> Some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper.</note> Alſo ſome particular Diſeaſes, which corrupt and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Nature of the Blood and Spirits, do occaſion this Diſtemper. From whence there follow a Symptomatical Conſumption (of which I ſhall make it my buſineſs to diſcourſe in the end of this Treatiſe,) as the Scurvy, Kings-Evil, Convulſive, and eſpecially Hyſterical Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, if they have been of a long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; alſo Fevers, and eſpecially Intermitting, and Scarlet Fevers, and ſuch as proceed from a Surfeit; ſo the Small-Pox, Meaſles, Stone in the Kidneys, the <hi>French Pox,</hi> an Aſthma, ſpitting of Blood, Inflammation of the Lungs, Pleuriſie, and other Diſtempers of the Breaſt ill cured;

                     <note place="margin">The more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate cauſe is taking of cold.</note>The Body being thus prediſpos'd to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption by theſe and other ſuch-like Proca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarctick Cauſes, the more immediate cauſe of this Diſtemper is for the moſt part the taking of Cold, from whence it comes to paſs, that in the Body diſpoſed in ſuch a manner by a load of Humours, or Water continually deriv'd from the diſtemper'd Habit of the Body into the Lungs, a Cough is cauſed, that is not eaſily ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, as that is wont to be, which happens from a meer accidental Cold, where the Matter is concocted within a few days into a putrid Flegm, and upon that is all perfectly thrown out by a Cough (as I ſhall ſhew more largely in the Chapter of a Catarrh.) Moreover from a ſtock of very ſharp and Malignant Humours, which were gathered before in the Habit of the Body, (as there is a continual ſupply of new Matter from the Circulation of the Blood) there is a continual and troubleſome Cough produced, and ſticks upon the Patient to his dying day: The <hi>Serum,</hi> or Water of the Blood being ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, as it were in a perpetual ſtream by the Glandulous parts of the Lungs, and not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of any Concoction until the Lungs, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Glandulous parts of them, ſwell from their being ſtufft, and grow hard, and at length the Tone of the parts is quite deſtroyed, and they are ulcerated by the ſharpneſs of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, that is ſeparated by theſe tender and ſoft ways: Which indeed is the immediate Cauſe of a Conſumption of the Lungs.</p>

Which Symptom is a thing that is very common with thoſe that have the Scurvy, and ſuch as are Hypochondriacal, and ſhews a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquative diſpoſition of the Blood: That is, that it cannot by reaſon of its too great and preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural ſharpneſs, perfectly aſſimilate to it ſelf the new Nutritious Juice, nor make it duly mix with it ſelf, and therefore throws it off upon theſe Glandulous Parts, and conſequently does in progreſs of time oblige the ſoft ſubſtance of the Lungs to receive it; from whence a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption commonly has its Original. 13ly,<note place="margin">

cannot make a full Meal as he uſed to do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the turning of his Stomack, and making him ſick: Neither indeed can he digeſt, or diſtribute the Food, which he takes, be ſure if he eats much, without an Oppreſſion at his Stomack, and a gravative wearineſs in his Limbs. Which is the very Symptom that opens the way to a Conſumption: For it proceeds from too great a fulneſs of the Veſſels, and the whole Habit of the Body, cauſed by ſtale and diſpirited Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Juice, by which means there is not room to receive new Chyle, and therefore Nature does not deſire it.

                  <p>The general Indications for preventing a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in this ſickly ſtate, are chiefly three.<note place="margin">The Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Cure</note> The carrying off by ſome way of Evacuation the diſpirited Chyle, that lurks in the Habit of the Body. The tempering of the Preternatural and Hectical heat in the Blood and Spirits newly cauſed by the ſtagnation of the Humours. And laſtly, the ſtrengthening of the Tone of the Parts, and conſequently freeing them from their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions; which being neglected, there is all the reaſon to fear an ill Habit of Body, and a return of the Preternatural Heat.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Gentle Purges to evacuate the Humors.</note>For this end, though ſtrong Purges (as I have before hinted) are in this caſe to be condemned, yet it is very convenient to carry off the load of Humours by Stool gently, and by degrees, with kindly and Stomatick Purges, until the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is freed from its bloutineſs and Obſtructions, and reduc'd to its firſt and Natural ſtate.</p>
                  <p>The Purges of this Nature are, <hi>the Stomack Pills with Gums, Aloephangin Pills, Aloes prepared with juice of Roſes, Maſtick Pills, Pill Ruffi, the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Draught with Senna,</hi> &amp;c. But I prefer the <hi>Tinctura Sacra, and the Purging Mineral Waters</hi> before any other ſort of Purge, which as they carry off the vappid Humours by little and little with eaſe, and without putting them into too great a motion, ſo they alſo rather temper the Heat, than kindle a new flame in the Spirits and Blood (which is often the effect of other Purges) and ſtrengthen the Tone of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, which in this caſe is weak and relaxt, and withal increaſe the Appetite.<note place="margin">Diureticks and Diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks for the ſame end.</note> For the ſame purpoſe likewiſe ſuch Medicines as provoke Urine and Sweat, are of great uſe in order to the more effectual carrying off of the naſty <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> of the Blood.<note place="margin">But a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian muſt be very prudent in the choice of theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.</note> But in chooſing of theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines a Phyſician ought always to be very cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and prudent, preferring thoſe which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the leaſt heat and ſharpneſs to the Blood before others.

becauſe that they are impregnated with more of a Mineral Spirit than any others (that I have ever yet try'd in ſeveral Parts of <hi>England</hi>) by which they penetrating like Lightning the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt corners of the Body, open Obſtructions, and provoke Urine very plentifully; and yet they do not affect thoſe that drink them, ſo as to make them giddy, and as it were fuddled, to oppreſs the Stomack, or to cauſe a great heat in the Hands and Feet at the end of their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing off, ſo much as other <hi>Chalybeate</hi> Waters uſe to do.</p>

                  <p>If the Blood ſeems but in the leaſt degree to grow preternaturally hot,<note place="margin">If the Blood be at all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternaturally hot, ſome muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away.</note> it is convenient in the very beginning to take away a moderate quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of it, in order to cool it, and to abate the fulneſs of the Veſſels. For although Bleeding is condemn'd in a Conſumption, when it is once confirm'd, becauſe the uſe of it at that time not only affords no benefit, but alſo procures the ſudden deſtruction of Nature: Yet nothing does conduce more to the preventing, or extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Hectical Flame which is in the Blood, if it be adminiſtred time enough. By which means (other neceſſary Medicines being alſo given in a due Method) the Inflammation and Swelling, and conſequently the Exulceration of the Lungs themſelves; yea, and the Conſumption it ſelf, together with a Cough, difficulty of Breathing, and the reſt of the train of direful
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59580:43"/>
Symptoms may be happily prevented. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed from what I have learnt by a great deal of Experience, I do not doubt but many fall into fatal Conſumptions from an Inflammation of the Lungs,<note place="margin">Many fall into Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions for want of due Bleeding.</note> a Pleuriſie, ordinary Catarrhs, and other Diſtempers of that kind, becauſe through the careleſsneſs of the Phyſician, or the Patient's fear, and the timorouſneſs of his Friends that are about him, there was not Blood taken away in due time, or ſo often as there ſhould be, or in a ſufficient quantity by opening a Vein. From whence it comes to paſs, that the Blood retaining a Hectical heat, the Lungs for a long time remain hotter than they ought to be, and upon that there is a conflux of the Humours flowing into the Part affected, or rather a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ſeparation of the new Chyle by the Glands of the Lungs: From which there follow violent and dry Coughs, Inflammations, and at length (when the Conſumption comes to its height) Exulcerations. And therefore I never do take away ſo great a quantity of Blood from other Perſons, that have a Fever, as from theſe ſickly Conſumptive People, whenever they happen to be Feveriſh, and this I have done with very good Succeſs, ſo that I do not remember that I ever yet repented of doing it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">If there be any Hectick heat with a Catarrh, an Opiate muſt be given.</note>If the Catarrh has but the leaſt degree of a Hectical heat joyn'd with it, and the other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the Patient allow it, the frequent uſe of an Opiate is alſo very neceſſary in this caſe, and that not only to quiet the Lungs, which at this time are heated by the continual and violent motion of the Cough, but alſo to temper and calm the whole Maſs of Blood. So that it is plainly convenient every Night, or every other Night to give <hi>a Grain and half of

London Laudanum in a little Conſerve of Red Roſes,</hi> or <hi>an Ounce of the Syrup of Meconium with three Ounces of Milk-water, and three Drams of old Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domick Water, or twenty Drops of Helmont's Liquid Laudanum in a ſpoonful of the Balſamick Syrup,</hi> which I ſhall afterwards deſcribe; <hi>or half a Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Hounds-tongue Pill,</hi> or <hi>the Pill of Styrax.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea,<note place="margin">And in this caſe every Purge, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſhould have an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate mixt with it.</note> and in this caſe no Purge except the Purging Mineral Waters ought to be preſcrib'd without mixing an Opiate with it, leſt the Cough and Heat ſhould happen to be increaſed by too great a Commotion of the Humours. As for Example: <hi>Take a Scruple or half a Dram of Aloes roſate, half a Scruple, or twelve Grains of Hounds-tongue Pill, mix them, and make them up into four Pills to be gilded, and taken when the Patient is to go to ſleep.</hi> Or, <hi>Take two Ounces and a half, or three Ounces of the Sacred Tincture, fifteen or twenty Drops of Helmont's Liquid Laudanum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This kind of Purges may be ordered every third or fourth Night, and two Quarts of the Purging Waters the following Mornings, either cold or boyl'd, according to the Seaſon of the Year.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe days the Patient does not Purge,<note place="margin">When the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient does not Purge, Diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks and Diaphore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks are to be taken.</note> the Phyſician muſt go another way to work, and endeavour to carry off the Humours gently by the Pores of the Skin, and by the Kidneys, and do it with the uſe of ſuch Diuretick and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoretick Medicines, as may rather abate than increaſe the Preternatural heat of the Blood.

                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Diagnoſtick and Pathognomonick ſigns of a preſent Conſumption,<note place="margin">The ſigns ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhew the beginning or confirmation of a Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</note> are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch as diſcover it when it is but begun, or when it is once confirm'd, and deplorable. The Pathognomonick ſigns of the beginning of a Conſumption of the Lungs are, Firſt, a Cough, which one may, and that by very certain ſigns diſtinguiſh from a ſimple Catarrh, how violent ſoever, and Chronical it may be, becauſe, ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeaking, the Part affected, or ſeat and ſource of both Diſtempers are not the ſame.<note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is known by a Cough diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from an ordinary Cough.</note> For a Conſumptive Cough proceeds from a Glandulous Swelling, or Tubercle of the Lungs themſelves, and that with the ſenſe as it were of ſome heavy weight in the Breaſt, as alſo a difficulty of Breathing, and other Symptoms of the ſame Nature, which I ſhall by and by particularly, though briefly, run thorough. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, a ſimple Catarrh owes its Original from a diſtillation of Rheum caſt out as it were in continual drops by the <hi>Uvula</hi> and Almonds, and the other Glands ſeated in the upper part of the Wind-pipe, yea, and by all the glandulous Coat of the Wind-pipe it ſelf. For the Wind-pipe by a certain Providence of Nature is covered on the inſide with a Nervous Membrane that has a
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59580:45"/>
very exquiſite ſenſe, which will by no means ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of any thing but the Air it ſelf, no, not a drop of the cleareſt Water without grievous trouble and oppoſition, and therefore when it is tickled by the going down but of the leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable Particle, it preſently endeavours with all its might to throw it up again by Coughing: And indeed Nature has made this Proviſion for very great Reaſons. For if a free and quiet paſſage were every day allowed but to the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt Body, or Particles, that are heterogeneous, how ſoon would there be an end of Man's Life by the ſtuffing of the ſmall branches of the Wind-pipe, which by reaſon of the ſtraightneſs of the paſſages uſe ſometimes to be ſtufft, and Aſthmatically ſtopt even by the Air it ſelf when it is thicker than ordinary. But how fierce ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever and continual this Catarrhous Cough is, as being provok'd by a tickling from a continual Excretion and Diſtillation of Rheum from the Glands in the Wind-pipe, yet as it is always at the beginning moiſt, and joyned with a great flux of Humours; ſo likewiſe it is accompanied with no weight, or oppreſſion of the Lungs, or ſhortneſs of Breath, which for the moſt part are obvious to our Obſervation in a Conſumptive Cough, and that in the very beginning.</p>
                  <p>Therefore this I make to be the firſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing ſign of a Conſumptive Cough; to wit,<note place="margin">This dry Cough from Tuber<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Yet it cannot be denyed but theſe Patients in the beginning of this Diſtemper,<note place="margin">Yet theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients ſpit a great deal of thin Rheum.</note> whenever the Lungs happen to be violently moved by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream

and deep Cough, ſo as to make them Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit (either after eating, or from any other Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident.) I ſay, theſe Patients do throw out a great plenty of thin, clear Spittle from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livatory Ducts, and likewiſe hawk up from the Tonſils ſome Glutinous Phlegm, that is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſalt, ſometimes inſipid, which may happen alſo to thoſe that are well ſometimes from the ſame cauſe, to wit, by reaſon the Salivatory Ducts, and Glandulous Parts ſeated in the Throat are ſqueez'd, and as it were milkt by this violent motion.<note place="margin">But yet it is a dry Cough.</note> But nevertheleſs this Cough is to be reckoned a dry one, becauſe there is no Rheum or Phlegm thrown out of the Wind-pipe, or the branches of it. And it is as true that this dry Cough uſes ſometimes to turn to a Catarrhous Cough, and ſuch as is attended with a flux of Rheum, as the Wind-pipe and the branches of it ſupply a continual flux of Humour, which is ſometimes crude, ſometimes in the form of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted Phlegm (as it uſes to be in a true and genuine Catarrh.) Which comes to paſs from hence, becauſe the Glandulous Coat of the Wind-pipe it ſelf, and the branches of it being irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by this long and violent motion of the Lungs (in the Nature of a dry Cough) cauſed by the Swellings diſperſed here and there through their whole ſubſtance, is continually emptied of its Liquor as if it were milkt, and thereupon does throw out daily an abundance of <hi>Serum,</hi> or Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter almoſt in the ſame manner as Milk is fetcht out of the Breaſts, and Spittle from the Saliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Ducts, by drawing them in a manner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually; or as an involuntary flux of the Seed in a ſimple <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> proceeds from the Glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſeminal Parts by frequent fribling.<note place="margin">How it may be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht from a true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrh.</note> But yet this Conſumptive Cough, when it is attended
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59580:46"/>
with a Catarrh, may be diſtinguiſht from a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Catarrh eſpecially two ways: Firſt, in that a Conſumptive Cough is from the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning dry for ſome Months (and ſometimes it may be for ſome Years;) whereas a ſimple Catarrh is at firſt humoroſe, as I ſaid before. Secondly, in that a ſimple Catarrh goes off in a few Days, at moſt in a few Weeks; to wit, ſo ſoon as ever that accidental Feveriſh Ferment occaſioned by taking of cold does by degrees once ceaſe to put the Maſs of Blood any longer into an extraordinary motion. Which being once done, the Glandulous Coat of the Wind-pipe does no more ſeparate or ſpew out any Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, but what it does Naturally. From whence it comes to paſs, that what remains of that Rheum, which is ſeparated by theſe Glands, being no longer attenuated with a new flux of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, is by degrees concocted by the Natural heat of the parts into a Phlegm that reſembles purulent Matter, and is cough'd up in that form, and thereupon the <hi>Serum</hi> or Humour being thrown out when it is firſt ſeparated, the Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules quickly recover their Natural Tone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hard Swelling, or Tubercle remaining. By which means it alſo comes to paſs, that the Cough, together with the tickling, wheeſing, ſhortneſs of Breath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ceaſe of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. But on the contrary, in a Conſumptive Cough, as the laſting and inexhauſted Fountain does ſupply a diſtempered Humour to the Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous Parts from the Maſs of Blood, prediſpos'd by a long abuſe of thoſe ſix things, which we call not Natural, and put continually into an inordinate motion by a Feveriſh Ferment ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually fixed in it: So from the Swellings di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed here and there through the ſubſtance of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59580:47"/>
the Lungs, and compreſſing the branches of the Wind-pipe, not without ſome trouble, the Wind-pipe it ſelf is provok'd to cough by a certain continual tickling: And this cauſes as continual a ſpewing out of a ſharp and diſtemper'd Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour all along the inſide of the Wind-pipe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til at length thoſe Tubercles growing very large begin to be inflam'd, and to turn to Apoſtemes. Whereupon as ſoon as any one of the Bags, or Cavities, which contain the Matter breaks, there is plainly in coughing (if there be a paſſage for it) a true and ſtinking Corruption thrown out from theſe ulcerated Swellings, mixt with ſome thin Humour, or Phlegm, that is plentifully ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed from the Glandulous Coat of the Wind-pipe. Neither indeed can the Patient (when the Diſtemper comes to be a Fatal Caſe) be ever freed from this Cough by any Art, till Death effectually ſtops it.</p>
                  <p>But let no one admire how thoſe Tubercles, or Swellings that are placed in the Lobes of the Lungs far from the top of the Wind-pipe, can provoke this dry Cough, together with a tickling in the upper part thereof; when he may every day obſerve the ſame kind of Chronical dry Cough cauſed and continued a long time by chalky ſtones generated in the ſubſtance of the Lungs. Yea, and once I obſerved the ſame Symptom to happen from three Nails, that ſlipt by chance (as the Perſon was laughing) through the Wind-pipe down into the Lungs, and to continue for a whole Year, the ſick Perſon all that while being in other reſpects very well.<note place="margin">How the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bercles, which are remove from the top of the Wind-pipe, do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect that part.</note> And indeed the thing it ſelf ſhews it, for the Wind-pipe is every where divided through all the Lobes of the Lungs into many branches, which are a great way diſtant from one another,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59580:47"/>
ſo that the very fine and ſmall Pipes of thoſe branches are propagated to the very extremities of the Lungs by the continuity of thoſe Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, which had their Original from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning or upper part of the very Wind-pipe. From whence it neceſſarily follows, that as thoſe Tubercles, in what part ſoever of the ſubſtance of the Lungs they happen to be bred, cannot but make a troubleſome compreſſion upon ſome of theſe ſmall Pipes, and ſtraighten them: So that troubleſome ſenſe, by reaſon of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of the Membranes, does affect the upper extremity or beginning of the very Wind-pipe, by a conſent of parts, as we commonly ſay; whereby it provokes the Wind-pipe to caſt out its Enemy by a vain and dry Cough: Juſt as we ſee every day in a Strangury, or difficulty in making Water from a ſtone preſſing uneaſily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ureter; yea, if it be the very Kidney, a great pain felt in the extremity of the Yard it ſelf, from the continuity of the Membrane: For in Nature's endeavouring to expel the Stone, there ariſes a Spaſmodick Contraction of the whole Urinary paſſage from the very Kidneys, which yet does very much affect the extremity of the Yard with a kind of heat of Urine.<note place="margin">The Nature of this Cough ſhews it to be from the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bercles.</note> And even the Nature of this Conſumptive Cough does likewiſe favour much this Opinion, whilſt it yet continues to be dry (as being cauſed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Tubercles) and before a diſpoſition to a Catarrh does in progreſs of time come upon it. For as it is dry, and without any expectoration, ſo it is not great, nor the Fits long, and is rather made of its own accord to relieve the Oppreſſion of the Lungs, then excited by a violent tickling, or accompanied with that great ſtraining, which uſually accompanies a Catarrhous and fierce
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59580:48"/>
Cough, that is cauſed by the continual excretion of a Wateriſh Humour by the Wind-pipe, and the branches of it.</p>
                  <p>But if any one ſhould be inquiſitive about the Original of the Tubercles in the Lungs,<note place="margin">A general Account of the Original of the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bercles in the Lungs.</note> which are the firſt occaſion of this dry and truly Conſumptive Cough, I ſhall give this general Anſwer: That the ſubſtance of the Lungs not only ſeems more obnoxious to a flux of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours (as the Ancients love to Phraſe it) than any other parts of the Body, from the continual motion of theſe parts cauſed in reſpiration; but alſo by reaſon of its ſpungy ſoftneſs (becauſe it conſiſts wholly of ſmall Bladders and Veſſels) is wont to ſuck in, and retain the Humours. And therefore, when all the internal and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Parts, as well thoſe that are Muſcular, as thoſe that are Glandulous, are very often affected with ſeveral ſorts of ſuch Swellings, why ſhould it be ſtrange, if they are frequently found here alſo, as they are in other parts of the Body? Yea, when I conſider with my ſelf, how often in one Year there is cauſe enough miniſtred for producing theſe Swellings, even to thoſe that are wont to obſerve the ſtricteſt Rules of Living, I cannot ſufficiently admire that any one, at leaſt after he comes to the Flower of his Youth, can dye without a touch of a Conſumption. And without doubt the breeding of theſe Swellings is ſo frequent and common,<note place="margin">The breeding of theſe ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings is very common.</note> that a Conſumption of the Lungs would neceſſarily be the common Plague of Mankind, if thoſe Swellings did not vaniſh, or were not removed by Art as eaſily as they are bred at firſt: And indeed I have been uſed to think, not without Reaſon, that as the more Benign Tubercles are wont to go off of their own accord, and that quickly, ſo none of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59580:48"/>
them lay the Foundation of this great Diſeaſe,<note place="margin">And when they are Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant, they occaſion a Conſumption.</note> of which I am now treating, but only thoſe, which are in ſome degree Malignant, and ill-natur'd, and that are wont to putrefie ſooner or later from ſome peculiar quality in their Nature, from what part ſoever of the Body they have their Original.</p>
                  <p>But that I may more particularly ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the beginning and riſe of theſe Tuber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles:<note place="margin">A particular Account of the beginning of them.</note> As far as I have been able hitherto to learn, either from the inſpection of the dead Bodies of ſuch as have had a Conſumption, or by Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; a crude Tubercle or Swelling is bred from the Obſtruction of ſome Glandulous part of the Lungs; to wit, when a greater quantity of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> or Water is ſeparated from the Blood, than is thrown out by the Duct of the Glandule: From whence it comes to paſs, that as the Part affected being too much diſtended by the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that is impriſoned in it, is deprived of its Natural Tone, and thereupon is no longer able to ſpew or throw out the <hi>Serum,</hi> or Water that flows into it, or is ſeparated; ſo likewiſe the Humour, that is ſo ſhut up, not being any more renewed by an influx of freſh Humor, does by degrees grow dry and hard from the Natural heat of the Part: From whence ariſes a hardneſs, that reſiſts a preſſure, or a Tubercle (of which we are now ſpeaking) which in progreſs of time, after the Natural Tone of the Part is in this manner deſtroyed, is wont to be inflam'd, and to turn to an Apoſtem ſooner or later, according to the Nature of the <hi>Lympha,</hi> or included Humor, and of the Blood, from which it is ſeparated, which indeed is the whole immediate cauſe of a Conſumption of the Lungs, and of the dry Cough which attends it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:59580:49"/>
                     <note place="margin">The cauſes of that Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which produces the Tubercles.</note>There remains yet ſome Enquiry to be made from what cauſe this Obſtruction, or Stagnation of the Humour in the Glandulous parts of the Lungs does proceed. And this is ſometimes from the thickneſs, and glutinous quality of the Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatick Juice, that is ſeparated in the Glandules; from whence it comes to paſs, that it is not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily driven on, nor thrown out by the very ſmall and ſtraight pore or paſſage of the Glandule: And this is wont to happen to thoſe that have the Kings-Evil ſwellings, and ſuch as have the Scurvy, by reaſon of the great quantity of fixt Salt, which their Blood has too much of. From whence it comes to paſs, that Perſons ſo diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd are more ſubject than other People to fixt and cold Swellings, and thoſe in the Lungs as well as in other parts of the Body, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they dye of a very Chronical, or lingring Conſumption. Sometimes alſo there is ſo great a quantity of Humour ſeparated in the Glandules from a violent and great Catarrh, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Faculty or Power by which the Part empties it ſelf, is plainly unable to throw it out. From whence it comes to paſs, that the way by which new <hi>Serum</hi> ſhould flow into it being ſtopt, the Water which is then retain'd within the Glandules, and ſtagnates there, does by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat of the Part gradually turn to a dryer Matter, and ſo into a ſubſtance that looks like Honey, or is of the Nature of a Suet, until the Tone of the Part being at length perfectly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by being too much diſtended, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows an Inflammation, and an Apoſtem upon it. And for this reaſon a Conſumption of the Lungs does often ſucceed to a Catarrh it ſelf, when a dry and hesky Cough comes in the room of that which was Catarrhous. Which dry Cough is
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59580:49"/>
cauſed by a Tubercle, or Glandulous Swelling, occaſioned by a Catarrh upon taking of Cold.</p>
                  <p>Moreover it is eaſie to obſerve that a dry Cough,<note place="margin">The ill Cure of a Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſy, &amp;c. ſometimes occaſions them.</note> and a very Acute Conſumption do often come from an Inflammation of the Lungs, a Pleuriſy, or ſome other Diſeaſe of the Lungs; to wit, becauſe either through the neglect of the Phyſician, or the timorouſneſs of the Patient's Friends, ſuch timely, or frequent, or ſuch plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Bleeding as is neceſſary to anſwer to the greatneſs of the Inflammation, is omitted. From whence it comes to paſs, that the Tone of the Parts, eſpecially thoſe that are Glandulous, being deſtroyed, are never able to recover their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſtate again; but here and there, in thoſe places where the Inflammation has before for ſome time prevailed, there are hard Tubercles to be found diſperſed up and down, together with a dry Cough, and a continual Hectick Fever; from whence ſuch Patients, being once ſeized with a very Acute Conſumption, dye with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few Weeks; for the Lungs having been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inflamed, do very quickly Apoſtemate, which brings on the laſt Scene of this Diſtemper, with all the uſual and fatal Symptoms accompanying it.</p>
                  <p>There is another Error in the Cure of this kind of Diſtemper no leſs fatal, and that is,<note place="margin">Sometimes from the want of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoral Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.</note> when the neceſſary clearing of the Lungs from the Phlegm, with which the Glandulous Parts eſpecially are ſtufft, is plainly omitted for want of uſing Pulmonary and Expectorating Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines; or when theſe Remedies are adminiſtred with too ſparing a hand. And much more,<note place="margin">Or from the unſeaſonable uſe of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates.</note> when that plenty of Lymphatick Juice, which is ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in the Glandules, is kept lockt up there by the unſeaſonable, and indeed fatal uſe of <hi>Opium,</hi>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:59580:50"/>
given in order to eaſe the pain. From whence it comes to paſs, that although the Patient be delivered from the danger of the preſent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, (which yet is very ſeldom the effect of it) yet by thoſe Tubercles, or Glandulous Swellings, which are left by this Method, a ready way is made to a Fatal and Acute Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption: Which ſhews it ſelf firſt by a Cough, ſhortneſs of Breath, and a Hectick Fever, but afterwards does quickly bring on all the direful and fatal Symptoms of this Diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The most uſual couſe is ſome Spaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the Lungs.</note>But the moſt uſual cauſe of theſe Tubercles is ſome little Spaſmodick, or Convulſive Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Lungs, that is long and continual, with the ſenſe of a weight and oppreſſion, cauſed by Grief, Fear, Cares, too much Thinking, and other ſuch-like Paſſions of the Mind. For as the ſoft ſubſtance of the Lungs, when they are contracted ſo long, and continually compreſt or ſqueez'd together, is wont to grow hard of its own accord; ſo likewiſe the Glandulous Parts of them being once deprived of their uſual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion, are not able to throw, or ſpew out, be ſure in a ſufficient quantity, that Lymphatick Liquor, which was ſeparated in them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no body has any reaſon to wonder, that as a ſtuffing of their whole ſubſtance, ſo likewiſe a hardneſs in the Glands themſelves, that reſiſts a preſſure, follows upon it. And thereupon it is eaſie to obſerve, that as Hypochondriacal and Hyſterical Perſons are more ſubject than other People to a Conſumption, though it be a Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical and lingring one; ſo likewiſe that Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſeizes them for the moſt part from the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſome Misfortune, which thing does firſt cauſe Fear, Grief, Thoughtfulneſs, or ſome
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59580:50"/>
other grievous Paſſions of the Mind, and that long and fixt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A Conſumptive Cough,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>2.</hi> A Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive Cough is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in the day time in the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</note> as it is for the moſt part dry, ſo in the beginning of the Diſtemper, at leaſt in the day-time, it is mild, and without any very great and vehement irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and often returns by long and uncertain intervals. But a Catarrh is in the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fierce, and almoſt continual. It muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be confeſt that both Coughs are violent and troubleſome enough in the night-time; to wit, a Catarrhous Cough, becauſe all ſeparation of the ſoul <hi>Serum</hi> by the glandulous Coat of the Wind-pipe and its branches is more plentiful at the time of lying down in our Beds; but a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive Cough, becauſe the Lungs are more conſtring'd and ſtraightned in this poſture of the Body. Whereupon as the branches of the Wind-pipe being more compreſt by the glandulous Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, have upon this occaſion more trouble from their compreſſion: So likewiſe there is a greater quantity of glandulous Liquor at ſuch a time preſt out of the Glands into the branches of the Wind-pipe, by which the Lungs are more ſtufft, and thereupon are likewiſe more provoked to cough: And from this continual motion of the Lungs cauſed by the Cough, proceed thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacious Watchings, which contribute more than a little to the increaſe of the Fever, which at firſt depended upon the Colliquative and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuos ſtate of the Blood. Though I have ſometimes obſerved, eſpecially in Conſumptive Perſons, that have been Hypochondriacal, long and troubleſome Watchings without any Cough, eſpecially after their firſt ſleep.</p>

From whence it comes to paſs, that the ſtock of new Chyle being in this manner thrown out, there is no more of it for that time carryed into the Lungs, and ſo the Lungs being quiet upon it, as not being irritated any more by an influx of new Chyle, the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack is at quiet too, and ſo the Cough and the Vomiting come to ceaſe together, until the Lungs begin to be irritated again from the taking in

For although I have known ſome that have been in a Conſumption, who have had for the moſt part a good Stomack, (that is, when the Fever, that has gone along with it, has been very mild) yet I ſcarce ever met with any, but had this diſpoſition to Vomit after eating joyned together with a Cough.<note place="margin">Though a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting does attend the Chin-Cough;</note> It muſt indeed be confeſt that this Diagnoſtick ſign is not proper to a Conſumptive Cough in the fourth Mood (as the Logicians uſe to ſpeak) that is, ſo that where-ever this is found joyned with a Cough, that Cough is a Conſumptive one. For although all Perſons, who are in a Conſumption, are wont in that manner after eating, to vomit up what they have taken, with their coughing, yet the ſame thing happens like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe every day to Infants, and Children that have a Chin-Cough.<note place="margin">Yet it is eaſie to diſtinguiſh them.</note> However it is very eaſie by the Age of the Patient, the continuance of the Symptom, the fierceneſs of the Cough, and other Circumſtances to diſtinguiſh this Catarrhous Cough from that which is truly Conſumptive.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The cauſes of the ſecond, or Inflammatory Fever.</note>And firſt, of the Inflammatory Fever, or the Fever from an Inflammation of the Lungs. This Fever has its beginning from an Inflammation of the Tubercles of the Lungs, to wit, when-ever one or more of thoſe Tubercles happen to be inflamed by the taking of Cold, the liberal drinking of Spirituous Liquors, too much Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, or from any other ſuch-like Accident, which by putting the Blood into too great a motion, may make it too hot, or elſe by too great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtention of the Tone of the Glands, or from the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59580:54"/>
peculiar Nature of the Humour contained in the Bags, and its diſpoſition to ripen, this Fever (which I uſe properly to call a Peripneumonick, or Inflammatory Fever) cannot but ariſe, and that with the conjunction of a difficulty of Breathing, (the expectoration or raiſing being then ſtopt, though the Cough continues violent) and oftentimes alſo of a pain of the Side, a Drought, Reſtleſsneſs, want of Sleep, a great and continual Heat, and other Symptoms of a Fever from an Inflammation of the Lungs. By which the Patient, ſo long as the height and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of it continues, is almoſt always confin'd to his Bed, and many times never comes out of it again.</p>
                  <p>And indeed this Fever is to be treated wholly in the ſame manner as other Fevers that are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with an Inflammation of the Lungs,<note place="margin">This Fever is to be treated like other Fevers with an Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Lungs.</note> that is, with a very thin Diet, the plentiful uſe of Pectoral and Expectorating Medicines, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward application of Anodyne Fomentations and Liniments, Pearl Cordials, and Temperate Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leps, but above all, with Bleeding, and that ſuch as is adminiſtred in due time, frequently, and plentifully, let the Patient be never ſo lean and Conſumptive. For by this means only is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to prevent the fatal Event of the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per at this time. For the Blood being once cooled by bleeding in time, and in a ſufficient quantity, the Fuel, which would maintain the Inflammation, is taken away, and the Flame, which is kindled in the Tubercles, is with the ſame eaſe extinguiſht in a day or two. But if this be neglected, the Patient dies within ſeven days with an Inflammation upon his Lungs, and all the Fatal Symptoms of this very Acute Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, which many times happens from the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59580:55"/>
negligence of the Phyſician, of the Patient, or his Friends; or at leaſt, though if he does not dye ſo quickly, yet he dyes as certainly, having an Apoſteme ſucceeding to the Inflammation of the Tubercle about the ſeventh day, and from thence this Acute and Inflammatory Fever turns to a Putrid Intermitting Fever, which though it be Chronical, yet is altogether as Fatal and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable.</p>

                     <note place="margin">This Fever ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns often in a Year.</note>Sometimes I have found (as in Mr. <hi>Tibs</hi> in <hi>Pater-Noſter-Row,</hi> and in a certain Merchant in <hi>Philpot-Lane</hi>) that this Peripneumonick Fever has return'd ſeveral times in a Year, to wit, as often as any new Tubercle happened to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd, whether it were from ſome evident cauſe, or from the Natural diſpoſition of the Tubercle it ſelf to ripen,<note place="margin">Some Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemes ripen ſooner than others.</note> and become an Apoſteme.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59580:55"/>
help of Phyſick, this Fever likewiſe ceaſes, tho' as often as the Part that is inflam'd happens to be turned to an Apoſtem, there forthwith comes in the room of it a Putrid Intermitting Fever, ariſing from the collection of Matter. And ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſpeaking, according to the Nature of the Swelling, and its diſpoſition ſooner or later to ripen into purulent Matter, the Peripneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monick Fever it ſelf, which proceeds from it, is ſooner or later cured; and according to the Malignity of the Humour, and the bigneſs and number of the Swellings that are inflamed, it is more or leſs Acute and Fatal. Whereupon tho' this Fever does for the moſt part come to a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod within the compaſs of ſeven days (for in that ſpace of time inflamed Swellings begin to turn to Apoſtemes) yet Scrophulous Tubercles,<note place="margin">This Fever generally ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates in ſeven days.</note> as they ripen very ſlowly,<note place="margin">Where the Conſumption is Scropho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, the time is uncertain.</note> ſo they bring an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory Fever, which, though it be almoſt inſenſible, and leſs dangerous, yet is Chronical, and ends in no certain number of days.

                  <p>I come, Secondly, to ſpeak of the Putrid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting Fever of Perſons in a Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as theſe inflamed Swellings of the Lungs begin to be Apoſtems (whether it be for want of Bleeding in time,<note place="margin">A Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Putrid Fever in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</note> or a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, or from the Natural diſpoſition of the Swellings to putrifie) this Inflammatory Fever is changed into a Putrid Intermitting Fever: Whoſe Fits for the moſt part obſerve no certain Order at firſt, but the cold and ſhivering Fits return often the ſame day, as it uſes to be when puru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Matter is breeding. But when the Matter
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59580:56"/>
is once perfectly made, this Fever imitates the Type of a <hi>Quotidian,</hi> and ſometimes (though ſeldom) of a <hi>Tertian,</hi> and that at a certain time of the day, beginning with a chilneſs and cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, proceeding with a great heat, and ſo at laſt ending in profuſe and colliquative Night-ſweats. During the time of the chilneſs and hot Fit, the Cough and ſhortneſs of Breath, with the other troubleſom Symptoms are increaſed: But during the time of the Sweat, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement of the Fever (the Cough and other Symptoms being mitigated) the Patient ſleeps quietly, recruits his Strength, and flatters him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the hopes, he is then ready to have, of his Recovery. And this Putrid Intermitting Fever I always reckon one of the moſt certain Pathognomonick ſigns of a confirm'd Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; becauſe as it proceeds from purulent Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bred in the Lungs, ſo it is an Infallible Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of corrupted Lungs. And from thence it comes to paſs, that this Putrid Intermitting Fever uſes to accompany a Conſumption (when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this Diſtemper happens to be Fatal) to the Patient's dying day. Whoſe Fits, and the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquations proceeding from them, are greater or leſſer, longer or ſhorter, according to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and number of the Tubercles that are ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened into Apoſtemes.<note place="margin">This Fever not to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red without the Cure of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer.</note> Neither indeed can this Fever be perfectly cured with the <hi>Peruvian Bark, Poterius</hi>'s Antihectick, or any other Specifick Medicine (having often tryed what they could do in this caſe) nor by any other Method that I know of, unleſs the Ulcer be ſo benign, that that can be healed by the help of Balſamick Medicines given inwardly, and the Maſs of Blood it ſelf (where the fuel of the Diſtemper lyes) can be brought to a good ſtate by the

                  <p>The Second Pathognomonick ſign of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd Conſumption, or that plainly diſcovers it to be ſuch, is a great and continual colliquation or melting of the Nutritious Juice, and a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual and plentiful ſeparation and running off of it from the Maſs of Blood by all the ways of Evacuation that Nature affords; from whence it comes to paſs, that a ſudden ſinking of ſtrength, and a <hi>Maraſmus</hi> with a <hi>Hippocratick</hi> Face follows in a ſhort time, though it comes gradually.<note place="margin">This Colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quation is proportionate to the degree of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick Fever.</note> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I muſt confeſs a Conſumption has from the beginning always ſomething of a Colliquation joyned with it proportionable to the degrees of the Hectick Fever, from which it proceeds, which diſcovers it ſelf by Night-ſweats, a Looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or ſome other way. Which Colliquation, though it be very hard to be cured, becauſe it depends upon a Hectick Fever, that is incurable, yet is always moderate, and brings but a very ſlow, and leſs ſenſible Conſumption, till firſt a Peripneumonick Fever from the Inflammation of the Swellings of the Lungs, and then a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid Intermitting Fever from the Exulceration of them, comes upon, and is joyned to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick. And then indeed as the Fever, ſo the Colliquation which proceeds from it, is increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. For the Blood being then continually foul'd by purulent Particles communicated to it, as it circulates through the Lungs, by the Swellings that are ripened, Nature when ſhe is ſo much loaded, and oppreſt with ſuch Heterogeneous Particles, that ſhe cannot bear them any longer,

In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Conflict ſhe is too much oppreſt, and therefore is affected with a chilneſs and cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but as ſoon as ſhe rallies her Force, and begins to get the better, there is ſo great an ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition and commotion made in the whole Maſs of Blood, that the freſh Nutritious Juice, which is then carried into the Blood-Veſſels, can no longer unite it ſelf to the Blood, but is thruſt forth, and thrown out in a large quantity toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the purulent Particles by any of the parts of the Body that are open and paſſable, as if they were melted, not without a great loſs of Strength, nor without a waſting of the Body, that is by this means continually deprived of its Food, which ſhould reſtore and nouriſh it. And the greater the Ulcers are in magnitude, and the more they are in number, the greater quantity of Heterogeneous Particles are mixed with the Blood as a Preternatural Ferment, and the more ſevere is the Feveriſh Fit, the Colliquation like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is ſo much the greater, and the Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion makes ſo much the quicker diſpatch.</p>

                     <note place="margin">This colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter runs off first by the Glands of the Wind-pipe and the Bronchia.</note>1. This ſeparation of the colliquated Matter is firſt made by the Wind-pipe and the branches of it, by which the Cough, that at firſt was dry, is now turned to ſuch a one as is attended with a great Catarrh, eſpecially when the Feveriſh Fit is going off: At which time a great quantity not only of a crude thin Matter, but likewiſe of concocted Phlegm, either purulent, or like Pus or Matter, and of ſeveral colours is thrown out of the Lungs by Coughing, until the Maſs of Blood, having thrown out that heterogeneous and purulent Ferment, or Leaven, does by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees

cool, and come to be quiet. And this Calm laſts no longer than till this deceitful and uncertain Truce happens to be broke by a new Fit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Then by the Pores of the Skin.</note> this ſeparation of the colliquated Humours is made likewiſe by the pores of the Skin in large and colliquative Sweats.</p>
                  <p>For theſe Sweats differ in their degree, to wit, according to the different degree of the Colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quation of the Blood, and of the Fever Fit, which precedes, and is the cauſe of it. For the Sweats always come on, when the Putrid Fever is going off, to wit, after Midnight. For this Fever (whether it be a <hi>Tertian</hi> or <hi>Quotidian</hi>) comes like other Intermitting Fevers at a certain hour (which is about Noon, or a little after) with a manifeſt chilneſs, but then proceeding for ſome hours with a burning Heat, Drought, Reſtleſneſs, Vomiting, ſhortneſs of Breath, a continual, fierce, and violent Cough, want of Sleep, yea, ſometimes alſo Light-headedneſs, and a very red colour in the Cheeks, proceeding from the Oppreſſion of the Lungs, and thoſe parts that are ſeated under the ſhort Ribs: But at length, to wit, about Midnight, it ends in vaſt and colliquative Sweats. At which time the Patient ſleeps quietly, breaths not ſo ſhort as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and plentifully coughs up concocted Phlegm without any difficulty or pains, having the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of the Fever all gone off altogether of their own accord. For at this time the ſtream of the colliquated Humour is turned from the Lungs, and carried to the Pores of the Skin. And by that means the Patient ſeems all the Morning to be free from a Fever, his Heat is moderate, and his Pulſe low, until at length another new Fit ſeizes him, and breaks the Treacherous Peace.

And from theſe remiſſions of their Fits it often happens that theſe kind of Conſumptive People, even when they are lookt upon as deplorable by others, flatter themſelves extreamly with the hopes of their Recovery; ſo that the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that at Night uſe to think themſelves irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable, and tell thoſe about them they ſhould certainly dye, yet the next Morning they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways pluck up their Courage, and in vain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the hopes of living long.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The ſtopping of theſe Sweats does no ways re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, but thereupon the Matter runs off from the Blood ſome other way.</note>'Tis true indeed, theſe Colliquative Sweats cauſing a great expence of the Nutritious Juice, do commonly ſpur on the Patient's Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and quickly make him a Skeleton. And yet he muſt not expect any relief or benefit from the violent ſtopping of them, either by the change of Air, or riſing out of Bed in the Night; which I have often ſeen prov'd true by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. For the Blood thereupon growing hot, does not melt or diſſolve ere the leſs, but when this paſſage of the colliquated Humour is once ſtopt by Art, Nature preſently opens ſome new Sluces to carry that troubleſome Load another way, (though it may be more inconvenient) as either into the cavity of the Breaſt,<note place="margin">As into the cavity of the Breaſt or Belly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> from whence there follows a Dropſie of the Breaſt, with an increaſe of their Cough, and an intolerable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of Breathing; or into the cavity of the Belly, and into the Legs and Thighs, in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Dropſie in thoſe parts; or elſe by the Glandules of the Guts, whereupon there ariſes a violent Looſeneſs, that is no leſs Colliquative than the Sweats themſelves: Yea, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times even a Bloody-flux (if the colliquated Humour be very ſharp) attended with dreadful Convulſions and Torments of the Bowels, which bids defiance to all the Medicines that are uſed

to cure a Dyſentery; as I found in the deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable caſe of Mr. <hi>Lechmere,</hi> and likewiſe ſome other Perſons that have been in a Conſumption, who being by that Symptom thrown into the laſt degree of a Conſumption, with a <hi>Hippocratick</hi> Face, dyed as quickly as they did miſerably. But this Thread of my Diſcourſe has unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly brought me to the other Diagnoſtick ſigns of a confirm'd Conſumption, of which I muſt likewiſe ſay ſomething briefly.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">The colliqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Matter when the Conſumption is confirm'd is exern'd by the Guts.</note> This Colliquation (as ſoon as the Conſumption comes once to be confirmed) is often made by the Glands of the Guts, in the Nature of a thin and wateriſh Looſeneſs, or elſe of a Bloody-Flux. For the Blood when it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in this colliquative ſtate aſſimilate the freſh Nutritious Juice to it ſelf, nor unite it to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Parts, by reaſon of its own Preternatural Heat and Sharpneſs, does frequently endeavour to drive it down, and throw it out as an unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Burden by theſe Glandules likewiſe. But Nature does not uſe to endeavour the expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of her Enemy this way, unleſs it be either for want of Care, or deſignedly that the High-way by the Pores of the Skin is ſtopt, or at leaſt, when this way alone is not ſufficient to ſerve her purpoſe, by reaſon of the greatneſs of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquation. And therefore a Looſeneſs is juſtly to be reckoned, for the moſt part, one of the laſt and fatal Diagnoſtick ſigns of a confirm'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. For excepting only the caſe of ſuch Perſons as have the Scurvy with their Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who are always ſubject to Colliquations of the <hi>Serum</hi> by the Glands of the Guts, and Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatory Glands, a Looſeneſs is wont to ariſe, and joyn it ſelf to a Conſumption not long before the Patient dyes. For as it ſhews Nature to be
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59580:59"/>
in a very great flame, ſo it ſtrangely haſtens and promotes its farther Deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">This Looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate to the preſent ſtate of the colliquated Blood.</note>This Looſeneſs is ſometimes moderate, in as much as it is always proportionate to the preſent ſtate of the colliquated Blood, but in others it is violent, and accompanied with racking pains, which uſually defies the power of Opiates, and all manner of Aſtringent Medicines; or at leaſt returns upon taking of the leaſt Cold, or drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a draught of Beer, or omitting the uſe of Opiate Medicines. And ſo long as the Looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſtopt by the Narcotick Power of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, we uſually have a difficulty of Breathing, in which the Patient is almoſt choak'd, or a Dropſie, or ſome other Symptoms no leſs trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, nor leſs dangerous ariſe. For the Blood being once brought by degrees to an irrepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and incurable ſtate of Colliquation, the crude Nutritious Juice, that is continually carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout in the Maſs of Blood, does, when one Door is ſhut, find ſome other, and it may be one that is more prejudicial and troubleſome to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient.</p>

Yea, a blouted ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the whole Habit of the Body, if the paſſages into the aforeſaid Cavities of the Body, and the lower Limbs, are either by Art or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident ſtopt. And in plain terms, a Dropſie coming upon a Conſumption, of what kind
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59580:59"/>
ſoever it be,<note place="margin">And not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd but of a deplorable Conſumption.</note> is to be reckoned amongſt the ſigns not only of a confirm'd, but likewiſe of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable and incurable Conſumption. And that not only becauſe it ſhews a very great flame in the Blood, and that the ſtate of it is extreamly colliquative; but likewiſe becauſe the Patient by reaſon of his too great weakneſs is not able to bear ſuch an Evacuation of the extravaſated <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi>-water, as is neceſſary, by ſuch Medicines as purge forth Water. And for Diureticks, they are plainly of no uſe in this caſe, becauſe even the ſtrongeſt of them cannot promote a Flux of Urine, but rather cauſe a greater Colliquation in the Blood, by attenuating, and heating of it more. Whereupon there is cauſed a greater and quicker flux of the Water into the cavities of the Body, and into the lower Limbs, where it has a free paſſage, ſo as to increaſe the Dropſie.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, and laſtly,<note place="margin">At laſt the colliquated Humours are thrown out by the glands of the Throat.</note> In this univerſal Colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quation Nature ſinking a little before the Perſon dyes, makes it her buſineſs to throw out the <hi>Serum,</hi> or Juice that is full of diſtempered and purulent Particles, by the Tonſils, and other Glands, that are ſeated in the Throat, as alſo by the Salivatory Ducts of the Mouth.<note place="margin">From whence ariſes, <hi>1.</hi> A heat in the Throat.</note> From whence there are wont to ariſe two new Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and they very troubleſome ones; to wit, a great heat about the Tonſils, and the Parts that ſerve for ſwallowing. Whereby it comes to paſs, that the Patient can ſcarce ſwallow any thing but with grievous pain. Which Symptom is wont to proceed from a light Inflammation of theſe parts, cauſed not only by the perpetual agitation of them by the Cough and external Cold; but likewiſe by the ſeparation and ſpew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Feveriſh <hi>Serum</hi> and ſharp Matter.

For hereupon Nature (when the Door by which the <hi>Serum</hi> uſes to paſs, is once ſtopt) endeavours, though in vain, to force out her Enemy by the paſſages of the Spittle. By which means it comes to paſs, that the parts of the Mouth being tinged with that ſharp Humour, happen to be inflam'd and ulcerated with the Acrimony of that diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd and feveriſh <hi>Serum,</hi> which is ſeparated and thrown out by the Glandulous Membrane of the Mouth. Which indeed is the immediate cauſe of this Symptom, which how troubleſome ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it is, does nevertheleſs plainly defie what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever either Art or Nature can do, becauſe the ſtock and fuel of it, that is heaped up in the Maſs of Blood,<note place="margin">This univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Colliqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion quickly brings a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſmus.</hi>
                     </note> cannot be ſpent.

And when the thing is at length come to this paſs, there are no hopes of the Patient's Life.

And indeed ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in a Conſumption, that are more cold and Phlegmatick, do uſe to perceive nothing amiſs, either in their Pulſe or Temper at any time but only then.<note place="margin">When there is an Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</note> But as ſoon as ever the Peripneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monick Fever, with an Inflammation of the Lungs ſeizes them, the Pulſe, as it uſes to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in other Peripneumonies, is not only quick, but alſo hard and ſtrong, yea, likewiſe riſes up more in one place than in another, ſo as to feel ſomewhat like a Saw, when one feels it with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Fingers together. Though ſometimes, by reaſon of the violence of the Spaſmodick pain cauſed by the Inflammation of the Tubercles, it is no rare thing to obſerve a weak Pulſe, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a coldneſs of the Extream Parts for a time, which may employ the Sagacity of the moſt Skilful Phyſician, to know whether he ought to preſcribe Bleeding, or no.

                  <p>HEre I could eaſily make ſeveral Diviſions of a Conſumption of the Lungs, and thoſe ſuch as are confirm'd by daily Experience; but, becauſe they neither afford any light to the forming of a true Notion of this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in general, nor help us to a clearer, or more diſtinct Underſtanding of the general Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Signs and Indications of Cure, I ſhall not ſo much as mention them, at leaſt in this place. But yet there is one Diviſion of a Conſumption of the Lungs, which is into an Acute,<note place="margin">The Diviſion of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Acute and Chronical.</note> and a Chronical Conſumption, without the knowledge of which, a Phyſician muſt needs be very often miſtaken, as well in the making of his Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, as in the diſcovery of the Indications of Cure. And therefore no one ought to think it improper, if I here add with what Brevity I can, my Obſervations for a fuller explication of it. For as I have ſeen ſome taken away by this Diſtemper within the ſpace of one, or at moſt of a few Months, ſo I have obſerved a great many others, that were far gone in a Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by due care, and by making uſe of proper means, who have lived, though in a ſickly and crazy ſtate, for many Years; as for Example, Mr. <hi>Haither,</hi> who after the Cure of a ſpitting of Blood, which he had been ſeized
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59580:63"/>
withal when he was a Youth, is yet living in the fiftieth Year of his Age, though in the whole courſe of this time he has been lean, troubled with a Cough, and often had touches of a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and been freed from ſeveral Putrid Fevers by our Art. And thus my dear Father, who himſelf was a very skilful Phyſician, though he was troubled with a continual Cough, a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of Breathing, frequent Putrid Fevers, a light degree of a Hectical Heat, though conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual, did nevertheleſs by this means ſpin out his Life, though he continued ſickly, from the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth to the ſixtieth Year of his Age; and at laſt did not dye of a Conſumption of his Lungs, (from which he ſeemed for the laſt three Years of his Life to be more free than he had been before) but of that Epidemical, that continued Putrid Fever, which reigned publickly all over <hi>England</hi> in the Year 1658. The ſame thing I obſerved in Mrs. <hi>Daviſon,</hi> a Merchant's Wife in <hi>London,</hi> for the ſpace of fifteen Years, and in a certain Merchant that lived in <hi>Philpot-Lane,</hi> who after ſeveral Inflammatory Fevers, that returned often in a Year from every little occaſion, at length happened to have ſuch an extraordinary exulceration of his Lungs, that he dyed of it, together with a Dropſie, and the other uſual Symptoms of a Fatal Conſumption of the Lungs, when he was about Sixty Years old. I could likewiſe give ſeveral Hiſtories of this Nature, but at preſent I ſtudy brevity.<note place="margin">The cauſe of this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> As for the cauſe of this difference, to me it ſeems to proceed from the different diſpoſition of the Blood, and of that Humour, which is ſupplyed to the Tuber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Lungs, and differs according to the various dyſcraſy of the Blood. For if the ſtuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing of the Lungs, and the Tubercles, which

ariſe from it, by reaſon of ſome peculiar dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſy of the Blood, have their Original from ſome malignant or cancrous Humour, or a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that is apt to cauſe a Gangreen, (as I remember it has ſometimes happened) the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper is not only certainly Mortal, but alſo quick, and very Acute, and ſuch as carries off the Patient in a few Months, and it may be Weeks. But if they ariſe from ſome benign, mild, and cold Humour, ſuch as is leſs apt for Inflammation and Putrefaction, the Patient gains a longer, though a miſerable Truce for his Life. But if the Maſs, that is contained in the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Glands, be (as it is often ſeen in ſome Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butical Perſons, and much more in thoſe that are Scrophulous) either not at all, or at leaſt but more ſlowly diſpoſed to an Inflammation and Putrefaction, the Diſtemper is very Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical, and the Patient living in a Conſumptive and Sickly ſtate for many Years, is at length ſometimes ſeized, and carryed off by ſome other Diſeaſe, as appears plainly from the inſtances I have before mentioned. For ſo long as the Lungs are only ſtufft, or the Tubercles, that ariſe from that ſtuffing, remain in a crude ſtate, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's Life, though it be miſerable, yet is not brought into any ſudden danger, though he is troubled with an Oppreſſion of his Breaſt, ſome difficulty of Breathing, and a frequent Cough; all which Symptoms are wont to be increaſed even from the taking of the leaſt Cold, or the committing of any Error in his Diet, and that with the addition of an uncertain Fever for a time. Likewiſe ſome degree of a continual He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Heat may be perceived in the Solid Parts, but eſpecially in the palms of the Hands, and the ſoles of the Feet; as alſo a redneſs in the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59580:64"/>
Cheeks, eſpecially after eating, and the drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Wine. The Pulſe alſo is ſomething quick, and ſometimes intermitting; the Appetite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant, and for the moſt part weak, at leaſt upon the taking of cold. There is likewiſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a lankneſs of the Muſcular Fleſh, than a plain Conſumption. That which they ſpit is ſometimes viſcid, and black, or of an aſh-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, according to the colour of the Matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the ſwelled Glands. Many times too a ſpitting of Blood uſes to return pretty often upon the leaſt occaſion. Which are the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, or Diagnoſtick ſigns of a lingring Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the Lungs, which notwithſtanding a Perſon, though he muſt expect to be always crazy and ſickly, may many times live a long time; but 'twill not be ſafe for him to indulge himſelf in the free uſe of Wine and Meats with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſtinction, and the choice of ſuch as are moſt convenient, nor of ſeveral other things, that conduce to the pleaſure of Humane Life, as others do. But as ſoon as a new Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, or Putrid, and Colliquative Fever is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the Inflammation and Apoſtemation of theſe Tubercles, all the Symptoms of a confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and deplorable Conſumption are wont to follow; which are more or leſs certainly and ſuddenly, according to the Nature of the Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, as they are more or leſs diſpoſed to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, and a quick Exulceration. And here perhaps it may be worth the while to add farther ſome particular Obſervations. As for Example.</p>

                  <p>WHat will be the Event of this Diſtemper, does plainly appear in the ſeveral Stages or Degrees of it, as well to our very Reaſon, as to Experience, from what I have already ſaid; and therefore I ſhall not propoſe my Prognoſticks, though found out by much Practice and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, after the uſual manner, that is, like a Dictator, and Magiſteriouſly, any further than as they are confirmed by Reaſon, and proved the Nature of the thing it ſelf.

But let it be whither it will, it is always very hard to Cure, becauſe it depends upon a load of Humours, and a ſtock of them heaped together in the Habit of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which cannot be emptied, or drawn out by any ſudden Criſis, like a Fever and other Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, that are properly called Acute.</p>

It admits of a Cure, I ſay, either true, or at leaſt palliative, according to the Nature of the Swelling, and the preſent ſtate of the Blood, from which there ariſes a Swelling more or leſs Malignant, and apt to be inflam'd and ulcerated: To wit, a true Cure, as often as theſe Swellings (being but few and benign) happen to be diſſolved by the Art of Phyſick: And a palliative Cure ſo long as thoſe Swellings can but be kept from an Inflammation and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulceration,<note place="margin">Though the Cure is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times only palliative.</note> by the help of Balſamick and other ſuch-like Medicines.

For as the veſiculous ſubſtance of the Lungs is almoſt continually penetrated by the Air, and by the Decree of Nature is blown up in the fartheſt corners of it by the continual ſucceſſion of new Air, that is driven in and out by Reſpiration, ſo the preſent ſtate of the Air muſt neceſſarily be of very great moment, ſeeing it may either hinder or promote the Cure of this Diſtemper, as it is found to be wholſomly dry and warm, or unwholſom by being cold and cloudy. So that the due conſtitution of the Air contributes not only to the Preſervation of the Lungs, when they are out of Order, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to their Cure more than the moſt pompous heap of Medicines, which cannot be conveyed into the Blood, and the Part affected ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, or in the ſame quantity as the Air is. And therefore 'tis uſually in vain to expect the Cure of a Conſumption in the Winter-time, and in Autumn, to wit, whilſt the ſtate of the Air being cold, thick, and moiſt, and conſequently unwholſom, does continually promote the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper more than a ſtore even of the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Medicines can ſtop and check it, when the edge of the moſt Powerful Remedies is taken off, and their Efficacy weakned in this manner by the extreamly incommodious ſtate of the Air.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>IN the beginning of this Diſtemper, to wit, whilſt the Lungs are only ſtufft, and being filled with diſpirited Chyle, and obſtructed (with the Habit of the whole Body at the ſame paſs) they have a Hectical Heat, and ſpew out a great quantity of <hi>Serum</hi> (which does often happen in a Conſumption proceeding from a Catarrh, and taking of Cold, that is, where the Body has been ſo prediſpoſed, and indeed continues a long time before the Tubercles, and the dry Cough, that proceeds from them, are produced.) I ſay, at this time the Indications are plainly theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication is to temper the heat of the Spirits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is to be done by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terative Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.</note> To temper the heated diſpoſition of the Spirits, by procuring a quiet and chearful Mind, and to mend the Maſs of Blood, that has been by degrees reduced to a ſharp and hectical ſtate, by the plentiful uſe of alterative Medicines. And ſuch we muſt reckon not only a Milk Diet, the Chalybeate Mineral Waters, and thoſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines that are commonly called Pectoral, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoft and mucilaginous, and ſo obtunding the ſharpneſs of the Humours, but alſo Balſamicks, and Specificks, which have a reſpect to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Conſtitution of the Patient. But the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies of this Nature muſt be taken plentifully, and ſo muſt be given (as much as can be) in the manner of a Diet, and they muſt perſiſt in
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59580:68"/>
the uſe of them for a long time: For the ſharp and diſtempered ſtate of the Humours, which has been contracted by little and little, is not corrected without a long and plentiful uſe of proper Medicines.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The ſecond Indication is to carry off the ill Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours by E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuations.</note>Secondly, Gently to carry off the load of the diſpirited and diſeaſed Humours lodged in the Habit of the Body, with convenient Medicines, as Vomits, Purges, Diuretick, and Sweating Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.<note place="margin">Which must be always gentle.</note> But all manner of care muſt be taken in the choice of theſe kind of Remedies; to wit, that they be very gentle and benign, left that by heating the Blood, and putting it into too great a commotion, and by that means bringing it farther into a colliquative and wateriſh ſtate, they ſhould by Accident increaſe the Diſtemper.</p>

But by the uſe of Oily and Lubri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating Medicines, the Humours that are lodged in the Lungs, and concocted, are more eaſily brought up by Expectoration. And if in their concoction they happen to grow more hard and

                     <p>Of the Method of Cure in an Original Conſumption of the Lungs.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">In the Cure of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in the beginning the influx of Rheum into the Lungs muſt be ſtopt.</note>IN the beginning of this Diſtemper (to wit, when the Lungs, the Wind-pipe, and Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules that are diſperſed through all that Pipe, and the branches of it, are at firſt only ſtufft by the conſtant ſpewing out of the <hi>Serum,</hi> that is ſeparated from the Maſs of Blood, and they are troubled with a continual Cough, eſpecially in the Night, proceeding from thence) the new influx of Catarrhous Rheum into theſe parts is to be ſtopt by all proper means, and the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours that are already lodg'd there, muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted as ſoon as may be. And therefore,</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">First, Some Blood must be taken away.</note>Firſt, There muſt be ſome Blood taken from the Arm, (eſpecially if the Patient has a fulneſs of Blood, and has before been accuſtomed to Bleed) to the quantity of Six, Seven, Eight, or Ten Ounces; not only to abate the Efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and conſequently the Colliquation of the Blood; but likewiſe to prevent the Swelling and Inflammation of the Lungs themſelves, and to take away the Feveriſh Heat, which is uſually cauſed by the continual agitation of the parts of the Breaſt by the Cough, and by the want of Reſt,<note place="margin">This must ſometimes be done more than once.</note> which follows upon it. This opening of a Vein (where the Indications require it) is to be done once, twice, or thrice, at due inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals; eſpecially where there is a flux of colliqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Serum,</hi> in the form of a ſuffocative Catarrh,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59580:73"/>
together with a plentiful Expectoration of crude Phlegm, that comes near to the Nature of a Rheum; or where there is a very Aſthmatical difficulty of Breathing, a pain of the Side, or any ſigns of a Rheumatick, Pleuritick, or Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripneumonick diſpoſition; or laſtly, where a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, or a too plentiful drinking of Wine, or other Spirituous Liquors have preceded. And indeed I do not at all doubt but Catarrhs,<note place="margin">For want of this, ordinary Coughs ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times turn to a Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and ordinary Coughs do very often turn to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the Lungs for want of due Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and fanning of the Blood in the beginning of this Diſtemper: And moreover we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuſpect that the Concretion, or hard knots in the Glandulous parts of the Lungs, and the Hectick Heat proceed from thence.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, After Bleeding it is very neceſſary,<note place="margin">After bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Vomit is neceſſary.</note> eſpecially if the Diſtemper had its beginning from a Surfeit; or if there be a nauſeating and diſpoſition to Vomit joyned with it, to preſcribe a gentle Vomit of <hi>Honey of Squills,</hi> or <hi>Oxymel of Squills;</hi> yea, and ſometimes of the Infuſion of <hi>Crocus Metallorum,</hi> to be taken in a moderate quantity. By which Vomiting not only the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, that was oppreſt with a load of Humours, may be eaſed, and the ſickneſs of the Stomack ariſing from thence, may be removed, and the Digeſtion reſtored (all which are to be highly valued;) but likewiſe the heap of Humours which were before lodged in the Lungs, uſes by the exagitation or ſhaking of theſe parts in Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, to be expectorated very conſiderably, not without a remarkable eaſing of that heavy weight, which was cauſed by that load. And I have not only ſeen ſeveral Empericks boaſt, and that not without good Succeſs, that they could cure any incipient Conſumption this way,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59580:74"/>
but likewiſe I my ſelf, by the Direction of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the Encouragement of Experience, have many times in the ſame manner ſtopt the Progreſs of a Conſumption in the beginning of it, in a very ſhort time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">And is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be repeated.</note>This Vomiting (eſpecially if the Patient bears it well, and finds Relief by it, and if it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary) may be repeated every third or fourth day, for three or four times.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The most convenient time to give a Vomit.</note>The moſt convenient time to give a Vomit in this caſe, is a little before the Evening, but they ought to bleed firſt the day before, for fear the Blood ſhould be heated by the violent agitation of the Parts, and by that means a Fever ſhould be brought on, or increaſed if there was one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: And likewiſe to prevent a ſpitting of Blood, which is wont to ariſe from the more vehement ſtraining of the parts of the Breaſt cauſed at this time by Vomiting before the Blood-Veſſels have been emptied. It is alſo very convenient when the Vomit has done working,<note place="margin">When the Vomit has done working we must give an Opiate.</note> to Order ſome <hi>Opiate,</hi> not only to temper the heat of the Blood excited by the ſtraining and agitation, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to hinder a new influx of Rheum into the Lungs, which uſes to ariſe from this violent agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the parts.</p>
                  <p>The forms of the Vomits and Opiates, which I commonly uſe in this caſe, are theſe which follow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Honey of Squills half an Ounce;</hi> let it be given in a Draught of Poſſet-drink, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated twice or thrice in an hour, if the Patient does not Vomit ſufficiently. Which is a Vomit mighty proper for Children and Young People, being gentle, and very grateful. Or,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take Oxymel of Squills, Oyl of ſweet Almonds, of each an Ounce. Mix them.</hi> Let the Patient
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59580:74"/>
take it diſſolved in a large draught of Poſſet-drink, and repeat it twice or thrice in an hour (if it be neceſſary) to promote his Vomiting. Or,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Infuſion of Crocus Metallorum ſeven Drams, Syrup of Violets two Drams: mix them for a Vomit.</hi> And in the time of its working (if it be needful) give <hi>Oyl of ſweet Almonds, and Oxy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel of Squills, of each half an Ounce, in a draught of Poſſet-drink once or twice.</hi>

                     <hi>Salt of Vitriol</hi> is not ſo convenient, becauſe it continually twitches, and irritates with its ſtyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticity the Glandulous parts about the Throat, and ſo uſes to cauſe a greater flux of Rheum, and ſo a troubleſom and long Cough after the Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is over.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Take old Conſerve of Red Roſes, Mithridate, or Venice-Treacle, Conſerve of Wood-Sorrel, of each half a Dram, of London Laudanum half a Grain.</hi> Mix them into the form of a <hi>Bolus.</hi> Or, let him take in the form of Pills, <hi>half a Scruple of the Cyncgloſs Pill, or as much of the Storax Pill.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Take the beſt Manna, Oyl of ſweet Almonds, of each an Ounce and half, or two Ounces, diſſolve them in a Pint of hot Ptiſane.</hi> Let the Patient drink half of it in his Bed, the other half, half an hour after riſing out of his Bed. Or,</p>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">After the working of a Purge, we must give an Opiate that Night.</note>But whenever he takes a Purge, that Night after it has done working there muſt be an Opiate given, as after the Vomits, to calm the Commotions in the Blood, and to give the Lungs ſome quiet, for fear there ſhould ariſe a new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of Humours into the Lungs from the agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Blood by the Purges.</p>
                  <p>And for the ſame Reaſon it is convenient to mix ſome Opiate with Stomachick Purges, to be taken juſt before they go to ſleep. As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>

So that I can from Experience confidently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that although Opiates are for the moſt part of ſome uſe in the whole courſe of the Cure of a Conſumption, yet they are more ſafe, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial, and neceſſary in the beginning, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the uſe of them no great matter can be done in preventing the progreſs of this Diſtemper.</p>

But now with a convenient quantity of <hi>Laudanum</hi> mixt with a Diaphore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, the Lungs are quiet ſo long as the Sweat laſts.

For I have always obſerved a new Colliquation to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from a Commotion of the Blood, that has been made before the Veſſels have been emptied, together with an increaſe of the Cough, and other Symptoms, that depend upon it; yea, and ſometimes with new Accidents of a ſpitting of Blood, of Rheumatick and Pleuritick Pains, and other dreadful Symptoms. The Diaphore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Medicines that I commonly uſe, are theſe which follow.</p>

                     <hi>Take of Venice-Treacle half a Dram, or two Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, of Old Conſerve of Red Roſes half a Dram;</hi> mix them for a <hi>Bolus.</hi> Or,</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Matthew</hi>'s <hi>Pills fifteen Grains,</hi> make them into two Pills, to be gilt, and taken when the Patient ſhould go to ſleep. Or,</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>The moſt ſeaſonable time to give theſe Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoreticks is at Night,<note place="margin">What is the best time to give Diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks.</note> and that preſently after an Evacuation by Bleeding, Purging, or Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, becauſe they procure ſleep. The Patient alſo muſt be freed from his Sweats with a great deal of care, leſt by the Pores being ſuddenly ſtopt in this colliquated ſtate of the Blood, he ſhould take new Cold, and thereupon the Cough and other Symptoms ſhould be increaſed.</p>
                  <p>During the uſe of theſe kind of Evacuations,<note place="margin">Whilſt theſe Evacuations are making, there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things to be done.</note> the Application of Veſicatories to the Arms, and between the Shoulders is very beneficial for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the violent flux of the Humours from the Lungs. But when we are making theſe Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations (which are very uſeful for leſſening the colliquated <hi>Serum</hi> of the Blood, and ſo for the Concoction of the Humours, that are already lodged in the Lungs) we muſt not by any means neglect the frequent uſe of thoſe Medicines which are commonly called Pectoral, or Pulmonary,<note place="margin">Pectoral Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines must be given plentifully.</note> which in the time between Evacuations muſt be given very plentifully, as it were in the manner of a Diet, but always in ſuch a form, as is moſt grateful to the Patient. For there muſt always be a peculiar reſpect had to the Stomack, (which

in this Diſtemper is commonly affected with a Sickneſs, want of Appetite, and Vomiting) leſt being offended with the form, and tired with the great quantity of them, it ſhould be uſed to a Habit of nauſeating, and throw up not only the Medicines, but alſo the moſt grateful Food. The beſt Medicines in the beginning of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper are ſuch as are Incraſſating and Lubri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating,<note place="margin">What of this fort are beſt in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> which by ſoftning the <hi>Serum</hi> of the Blood, conduce very much not only to the allaying of the Cough, but likewiſe to the Concoction and Expectoration of the Humours, that cauſe the Cough.</p>
                  <p>But theſe Incraſſating and Expectorating Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines may be given ſometimes ſeparately, but for the moſt part mixt together in a compound form, that we may anſwer both Indications at once.

                  <p>For Lubricating Medicines, let the Patient plentifully uſe <hi>New Butter,</hi> that has not been ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in all his Spoon-meat, <hi>Butter'd-Ale,</hi> and (if he bears it well) common <hi>Sweet Oyl,</hi> or rather <hi>Oyl of Sweet Almonds,</hi> but eſpecially <hi>Linſeed-Oyl</hi> freſh drawn without Fire, of which let him take a Spoonful every hour, unleſs there be a Looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or ſome other Symptom that forbids it.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Pulp of Marſh-mallow-Roots preſt through a ſieve, an Ounce, Sugar of Pearl, Gum Arabick, Tragacanth, white Starch, all diſſolved in red Poppy-water, of each two Drams, of Saccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Penidiatum diſſolved in Roſe-water a ſufficient quantity;</hi> mix them, and make them into Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenges of a Dram weight.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe when the Cough is very troubleſome, let the Patient take often, or at pleaſure, a piece of <hi>Sugar of Pearl, of Roſes, Penidiate, or Loaf-Sugar,</hi> letting it diſſolve, and go down gently. The Juice and Root of <hi>Liquorice</hi> are likewiſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to this end.</p>
                  <p>But if the Cough be long and violent,<note place="margin">If the Cough continues ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, we muſt uſe Balſamicks.</note> and does not yield to the former Remedies, ſo that from the Lungs being long ſtufft there is reaſon to ſuſpect that Tubercles will at length breed; then there muſt be a recourſe had to the uſe of Balſamicks. As for Example: Let the Patient take three times a day at Phyſical hours three of the following Pills (the good ſucceſs of which in Conſumptive Coughs I have now experienced for many Years) in a Spoonful or two of ſome convenient <hi>Linctus,</hi> drinking after them a draught of the Pectoral <hi>Apozeme</hi> already deſcribed, warm.</p>

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59580:80"/>
make them up into Pills of a middle ſize, to be gilt, or put up in Pouder of Liquorice.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Pills do mightily promote the Cure of this Diſeaſe, not only in the beginning, but alſo in the progreſs of it, in the lingring Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch as are Scorbutical, or have the <hi>Kings-Evil</hi> (which are Conſumptions that are very frequent) where the Fever (if there be any) is very moderate, and the Phlegm, that is ſpit up, is ſomewhat tough, like that in Aſthmatical people, as I ſhall ſhew more at large, under the Heads of a Scorbutical Conſumption, and a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption from the <hi>Kings-Evil.</hi>

                     <p>Of the Cure of a Conſumption in the ſecond degree of it, to wit, when from the want of a due Expectora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and from the Matter, that was lodg'd in the Lungs, thereupon ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long in them, ſome crude Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bercles ariſing from the knotty Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Glands of the Lungs, happen to come upon a long Cough.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IT often ſo happens to Conſumptive Perſons,<note place="margin">Conſumptive Perſons ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ask a Phyſician's Advice in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Diſtemper.</note> that either from Want, Covetouſneſs, or elſe an averſeneſs to Phyſick, taking the beginning of a Conſumption for an ordinary Cold, that will go away of its own accord, they very ſeldom ask the Advice of Phyſicians in the firſt degree of the Diſtemper, when it may be eaſily cured by Evacuations, and the reſt of that Method, which we have already deſcribed. But content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves with I know not what Receipts of Old Women and Empiricks, they ſquander away their precious Time, ſcarce deſiring the Aſſiſtance of a Phyſician, until by reaſon of the increaſe of the Hectick Fever, and the loſs of their ſtrength, they are plainly uncapable of the Evacuations, which we have before preſcribed, which yet are very neceſſary to the juſt and regular Cure of this Diſtemper.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:59580:82"/>
                     <note place="margin">Through their neglect, their Lungs come to be knotted.</note>From which neglect it often comes to paſs, that the Matter having ſtuck a long time in the Lungs; Tubercles or Glandulous Swellings are by degrees bred in them, whereby the Cure in this ſecond degree of the Diſtemper is rendred not only more difficult, but likewiſe more uncertain; the Diſeaſe admitting no Cure, or at leaſt but a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liative one. And from hence it comes to paſs, that a Conſumption has ſo ill a Name,<note place="margin">At firſt a Conſumption is eaſily cured.</note> as if it were a Diſtemper altogether incurable in its own Nature, when (as far as I apprehend from what I have been taught by Experience) it does ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of as certain a Cure as other Diſeaſes, ſo it be timely treated in a due Method. Though it muſt be confeſt that as other evil Affections of the Body,<note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs in ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular caſes.</note> ſo likewiſe a Conſumption where it ſeizes the Patient by Inheritance, if it ariſes from an ill conformation of the Breaſt, or depends upon an inexhauſtible ſtock of Humours, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by a long and habitual uſe of the ſix things, which we call not Natural: Or laſtly, where it proceeds from a peculiar Malignity, a Cancrous, or Gangrenous diſpoſition of the Blood, or ſomething in the Nature of it, that makes it apt to be quickly inflam'd, it does not uſe to yield to any Regular Method of Cure, though it be obſerved never ſo early: But every day it runs on with ſpeed to the third degree of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, notwithſtanding the uſe even of the moſt Generous Medicines.<note place="margin">The time from whence the ſecond degree of a Conſumption is to be reckoned.</note> But this ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the Diſtemper is to be reckoned from the firſt beginning of the Tubercles, until thoſe Swellings in the Lungs happen to be very much inflamed, and to putrifie; that is, ſo long as they remain in a crude ſtate.<note place="margin">The Tubercles are not all of the ſame Nature.</note> For theſe Tubercles are not all of the ſame Nature, but they aſſume a various, and very different diſpoſition; for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59580:82"/>
they are Malignant, of a Cancrous Nature, apt to Gangreen, and threaten a ſudden De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: But ſometimes though they are more benign, yet they are of the Nature of Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, Boyls, or a St. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Fire, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a pain, and Inflammatory heat, and ſubject to a ſudden putrefaction, and thereupon from their firſt breeding they cauſe a Peripneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monick Fever, and have a very quick tendency to Apoſtemes.<note place="margin">Some quickly Apoſtemate, and theſe make a quick tranſition to the third de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</note> So that as in this quick kind of Conſumption ariſing from Tubercles of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, there is no room for this ſecond degree of the Diſeaſe; ſo I ſhall not here ſay any thing more of it. For whatever relates to the Cure of it, is to be ſpoken of in the third degree of this Diſtemper, to wit, when I ſhall particularly make it my buſineſs to treat of the Peripneumo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick and putrid Colliquative Fevers of Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive perſons.</p>
                  <p>But for the moſt part theſe Tubercles are Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous Tumours of a Chronical and cold Nature,<note place="margin">For the most part they are Chronical, and of a cold Nature.</note> and ſomewhat like <hi>Kings-Evil</hi> Swellings, having their Original from the glutinouſneſs of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, or from an Obſtruction of the pore or duct of the Glandules; from whence it comes to paſs that the Humour ſtagnating within them, is gradually concocted by the Natural heat of the part into the form of Chalk, or into a ſubſtance like Suet, or like Honey, and yet is always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in its proper Bag; and thereupon ariſes immediately that hard Swelling, which I call a crude Tubercle; which although in progreſs of time it may grow to a conſiderable bigneſs, yet is not preſently inflam'd, and turn'd to Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, until from the Acrimony contracted by the Humour in its Bag, or from the Tone of the part being too much diſtended, there comes on
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59580:83"/>
from ſome Accident an Inflammation, and upon that an Apoſteme.</p>
                  <p>So long as this crude ſtate of the Tubercles of the Lungs laſts, the Conſumption remains in its ſecond degree.<note place="margin">The Diagno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick ſigns of Tubercles in the Lungs, are, <hi>1.</hi> An increaſe of the Hectick Fever.</note> The Diagnoſtick ſigns whereof are eſpecially to be taken, Firſt, from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable increaſe of the Hectick Fever, which at this time does often begin in ſome meaſure to imitate a Putrid Intermitting Fever, by reaſon of the Acrimony that is at length procured to the Matter contained in the Bags.<note place="margin">

Thirdly, from the dryneſs of the Cough, which how frequent and troubleſome ſoever it is, yet is not accompanied with a Catarrh, and ſuch a frequent ſpitting, as before. Fourthly, from the heavy weight and oppreſſion which are always felt in the Breaſt. To which alſo for the moſt part there uſe to be joyned a difficulty, ſhortneſs, and trouble in Breathing.<note place="margin">Purges, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, and Diaphore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks are hurtful at this time.</note> In this degree of the Diſtemper all Evacuations by Stool, by Vomit, or by Sweat are miſchievous, becauſe they promote the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and quicken the pace of the Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

And then too by reaſon of the preſent Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and Weakneſs, the Blood muſt rather be cooled by drawing it off with a ſparing Hand, than taken away in a large quantity.

he muſt diligently perſiſt in the uſe of thoſe Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering and Pectoral Medicines, which have been already deſcribed (ſo far as the Stomack can bear them.) But the chiefeſt benefit is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the long uſe of Balſamick Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, as of my Balſamick Pills before preſcribed,<note place="margin">But Balſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks are eſpecially proper.</note> and of other things of the like kind (ſo there be no conſiderable Fever:) And by this means I have (with the Bleſſing of God) recovered a great many Conſumptive Perſons (whoſe Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bercles ſeemed to be of a cold Nature, and crude, and ſo the Conſumption ſlow, and Chronical) to a former ſtate of Health, and the Lives of ſome I have preſerved ſeveral Years, though they have continued ſickly.

                  <p>But now beſides the altering Medicines (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready deſcribed) which are given in a little quantity, and at certain hours,<note place="margin">The altering Medicines.</note> we muſt do all we can to temper the Feveriſh Heat of the Blood, and to eradicate the inexhauſted ſtock of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours lurking in the Habit of the Body, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Colliquation ariſing from it, by making the Patient take them plentifully, and continually in the manner of a Diet. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt not only diligently make choice of ſuch Food as affords good Juice, and corrects the ſharpneſs of the Humours, as Partridges, and Mountain-Birds, potch'd Eggs, Oyſters, the Feet of Animals, together with Gelly-Broths, and Gellies made of them; alſo Craw-fiſh, and other
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59580:84"/>
Teſtaceous Fiſhes, with Broths artificially made of them; ſome forms of which I ſhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſubjoyn; but alſo the <hi>Chalybeate</hi> Mineral Waters, a Pectoral Mead, a Milk Diet, Aſſes Milk, Milk-water, Pig-water, Snail-water, and other Liquors, that ſoften and take off the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Blood, muſt be ordered to be taken plentifully in the manner of Drink: Likewiſe Iſſues, ſhaving of the Head, and the application of proper Plaiſters are of great advantage. Of the uſe of which, and the Cautions that are to be taken in the uſe of them, I ſhall briefly and particularly propoſe my own Obſervations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">If the Hectick heat is ſmall, we muſt uſe the <hi>Chaly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beate</hi> Waters</note>And firſt, if the Hectical Heat be moderate, and almoſt inſenſible, from whence we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture that thoſe fixt Swellings of the Lungs are crude, or at leaſt ſcrophulous, and of a cold Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that they are ſtufft with a chalky, fatty, or any other ſuch kind of Matter; the Patient muſt by all means be put upon the uſe of the <hi>Chalybeate</hi> Mineral Waters in the Summer time. And by this means I have relieved a great many of this kind of Conſumptive Perſons for many Years, reſtoring their Appetite, their Fleſh, and Strength, abating their Hectick Heat, and Cough, and giving then a greater freedom of Breathing; and that not only during the time of their drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Waters, but alſo all the next Winter. From whence we have reaſon to conclude, that thoſe Swellings, if they are not perfectly eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by the uſe of the Waters, at leaſt are leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened, and the Maſs of Blood mightily temper'd by them. And this palliative Cure (if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not obtain a perfect one) is of ſome moment. For although the Patient prolongs his Life in a ſtate ſomewhat ſickly, yet ſtill he lives, and by taking due care is able to do his uſual Buſineſs,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:59580:84"/>
and to have a moderate Enjoyment of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Delights of Humane Life. But I have ſeen ſome perfectly recovered from an evident Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption by the uſe of theſe Waters, and made ſound again without a Relapſe; a Hiſtory or two of whom I ſhall faithfully and briefly relate in the Chapter of a Hypochondriacal Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. But for the uſe of the <hi>Chalybeate Waters,</hi> I would recommend the following Rules ſtrictly to be obſerved by all Conſumptive Perſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in an Acute Conſumption, to wit,<note place="margin">Rules to be obſerved in the uſe of the <hi>Chalybeate</hi> Waters.</note> where the Lungs are evidently putrefied, and where the Fever is advanced beyond the degree of a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick; as alſo in an extream Chronical Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, where the Patient is come to ſome degree of a <hi>Maraſmus,</hi> together with Colliquative Sweats, a Looſeneſs, or Dropſie, the Waters muſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, which moſt certainly in this caſe are not only miſchievous, but alſo deadly. Secondly, thoſe that are ſick of a Conſumption, though they ought to ſpend a long time, to wit, the greateſt part of the Summer, in the uſe of the Waters, that the <hi>Craſis</hi> of the Blood, which is almoſt quite deſtroyed, may by degrees be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored by the long uſe of them, yet they muſt drink them ſparingly every day, and in a leſs quantity than others are wont to do, that is, four, five, or ſix Pints at a time, leſt by too great a diſtention of the tender Veſſels of the Lungs, there comes at length a ſpitting of Blood. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, during the uſe of the Waters, they ought to take more care, leſt they get cold, and commit any Errors in their Diet, than many Perſons, that are ſick of other Diſtempers, commonly do. Fourthly, it is convenient for Conſumptive Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to repeat the uſe of the Waters for ſeveral Years in the Summer-time, though after they
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59580:85"/>
have been uſed to them it is not neceſſary to drink them ſo long every Year, as at firſt. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, neither are Conſumptive Perſons to be purged during the uſe of them, as other Water-drinkers uſe to be. But if they are ſubject to be more coſtive than they ſhould be, it is convenient be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they fall upon the uſe of the <hi>Chalybeate</hi> Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and after they have made an end of drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, to give them the Purging Mineral Waters in a moderate quantity, and to repeat them every three or four days, till they have taken them three or four times. Sixthly, if the Waters do not paſs off in a ſufficient quantity by Urine, much more if they cauſe a Looſeneſs, they muſt not perſiſt any long time in the uſe of them, unleſs we can by Art provide ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently againſt theſe Inconveniences. To take off, and prevent a Looſeneſs, I uſe to order the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of a Wallnut of the following Electuary every Night, when they go to Bed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take the pulp of Old Conſerve of Red Roſes, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malade of Quinces, of each half an Ounce, of Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Amber three Drams, Bole, Dragons-blood, of each half a Dram, of London Laudanum three Grains, of Syrup of Myrtils enough to make an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To promote the paſſing of the Waters by Urine, they muſt diſſolve a Scruple of the fineſt <hi>Salt of Amber</hi> very well cleared from the Oyl in the firſt draught of the Waters. Seventhly, it likewiſe does very well, during the uſe of the <hi>Chalybeate</hi> Waters, to order their ordinary Drink to be impregnated with a Bag of Pectoral Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients; to which may alſo be added ſuch as are proper for the Scurvy and the Kings-Evil, that are mild, if the Original Diſtemper requires it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:59580:85"/>Secondly,<note place="margin">If the Hectick heat is great, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption quick, we muſt rather make uſe of a Milk Diet. The Rules that are to be obſerved in a Milk Diet.</note> but if the Hectick Heat be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, and thereupon the Conſumption quick in its Progreſs, it is better to temper the heat with a Milk Diet, than with the Waters. But about a Milk Diet we muſt obſerve theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rules. Firſt, In the uſe of this Diet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing muſt be either allowed, or taken for Meat and Drink, but Milk, and things made of Milk (except Bread.) But they muſt take this Food in a good quantity, and frequently, for fear the parts ſhould be deprived of their due Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by reaſon of the thinneſs of it. Secondly, a Courſe of the Milk Diet ought to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued a Month or two. Thirdly, the Spring is the moſt convenient time of all for this Diet, that is, when the Flowers and Herbs, with which the Beaſts are fed, are freſh.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">If common Milk will not agree, we must uſe only Aſſe's Milk.</note> But if there be too Acid a Ferment in the Stomack that turns common Milk into a hard Curd, and makes it uncapable of being concocted, (as it ſometimes happens) from whence their commonly follow Vomitings, Gripes, and a Looſeneſs, it is better to abſtain from the uſe of common Milk, and to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to temper the Blood with Aſſe's Milk; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the uſe of which theſe following things are alſo to be obſerved.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n the Morning, ſo that the Patient may ſleep in his Bed afterwards, and then again at five a Clock <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n the Afternoon. Secondly, That nothing elſe of a different Nature is to be taken into the Stomack either in the form of Food, or of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine before the Milk is concocted. Thirdly, The Quantity, or Doſe of Milk for one time is from half a Pint to a Pint, or there-abouts. For <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he Stomack can neither receive nor digeſt a
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:59580:86"/>
great quantity of this, as neither of common Milk, but uſes preſently to caſt it out, either by Vomiting, or Stool, and that to the great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the Patient. And therefore it is Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently adviſed by Phyſicians, that the Stomack be by little and little accuſtomed to this kind of Nouriſhment, beginning at half a Pint, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the quantity every day, till they riſe to a Pint. Fourthly, If the Patient, by reaſon of the Acid Ferment of his Stomack, be ſubject to a Looſeneſs from the uſe of Aſſe's Milk, (which often happens) the Milk muſt be ſweetned with <hi>Sugar of Roſes,</hi> and milkt upon a ſprig or two of <hi>Mint.</hi> Yea, if it be neceſſary, and nothing contraindicates, let the Patient every Night take a Grain of <hi>London Laudanum,</hi> or a Doſe of the <hi>Aſtringent Electuary,</hi> which I have already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. Fifthly, This Milk ought always to be given in its own Natural Heat as it comes from the Aſs. For if it has been once cold, and is warmed again, it is not only made leſs grateful to the taſte, and to the Stomack, but alſo by lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing its Spirituous part, it loſes ſome of its Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Sixthly, During the uſe of the Aſſe's Milk, they muſt abſtain from all other Medicines, (which is a Rule ought to be preſcrib'd as well in every Milk Diet) excepting <hi>Opiates</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringents,</hi> if they ſhould be neceſſary to prevent a Looſeneſs, or to quiet the violent Cough in the Night-time. Seventhly, But if a Looſeneſs that is cauſed by the Milk ſhould not be ſtopt with the uſe of <hi>Laudanum,</hi> and <hi>Aſtringent</hi> Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines; or if a Vomiting, or at leaſt a continual Sickneſs, and gravative Oppreſſion of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack ſucceed to the ſtopping of the Looſeneſs (which are certain ſigns that the milk curdles in the Stomack.) Or laſtly, if there are ſigns of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59580:86"/>
a Schirrous, and very obſtructed Liver, (which is no rare thing in Scorbutical and Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driacal Perſons in a Chronical Conſumption) then they muſt carefully abſtain from all ſorts of milk: For the uſe of milk is wont by increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Obſtructions of the Liver, to bring the Jaundice and a Dropſie upon the Conſumption, whereby the Original Diſtemper becomes plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deplorable.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">If Aſſe's Milk diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agrees with them too, then we muſt uſe Shell-fiſh, Teſtaceous Medicines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> Therefore in theſe caſes it is better to alter the Blood, and to correct the Acrimony of it with the plentiful uſe of Shell-fiſh, and of Teſtaceous Medicines; as alſo with Jelly Broths made of the Feet of Animals, and drinking a good quantity of Compound Waters made with Milk, of a Capon, a Pig, Snails, and other things of that Nature.<note place="margin">The Phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Waters of Snails <hi>&amp;c.</hi> must not be uſed, where there is an Obſtruction of the Liver.</note> Although what I have already hinted concerning the uſe of milk, is alſo true of theſe Phlegmatick Waters, to wit, that as often as the Liver happens to be before obſtructed, a Jaundies and Dropſie are wont to follow upon the plentiful drinking of them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this kind of Icterical, and Hydropical Perſons it is more convenient to endeavour to ſweeten the Blood in the manner following: Let them feed plentifully upon River, and Sea Craw-fiſh, Lobſters, and in general all ſorts of Shell-fiſh. Which ſort of Food being taken plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully, does very much temper the four ſtate of the Blood, and correct the Acid Ferment of the Stomack. And of theſe Shell-fiſh may be made by Art very pleaſant Broths, which muſt be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in good quantities.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Craw-fiſh an Hundred,</hi>

                     <hi>Take ſhavings of Harts-horn, of Ivory, of each four Ounces, two blades of Mace, the candied peel of an Orange ſliced; boyl them in two Quarts of Spring-water to a Quart, or a Pint and half. Strain it, and let the Patient, when he pleaſes, take three or four ſpoonfuls by it ſelf, or with warm'd Broths.</hi> Theſe kind of Jellies may be made grateful to the Patient's Palate, by adding at the time when they take it, a little <hi>Syrup of Baum, of Cloves, of Rasberries,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acids do not well agree with Jellies.</note> 
                     <hi>Oranges, or Lemons.</hi> Though it muſt be confeſt that Acid Syrups do not ſo well agree with Jellies, becauſe they do in ſome meaſure ſpoil their Vertue.</p>
                  <p>For an Example of a Jelly Broth, take this which follows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take one Capon drawn, and cut to pieces, two pair of Sheeps-feet, two pair of Calves-feet, ſhavings of Ivory, of Harts-horn, of each half an Ounce, two blades of Mace, one Nutmeg ſliced, of yellow Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders three Drams, or half an Ounce. Boyl them all gently in a Gallon of Spring-water to two Quarts, adding when they are almoſt boyled enough, of right Malaga Wine a pint, the Flowers of great Daiſies, Colts-foot, Maiden-hair, ſpotted Lungwort, of each a handful, of fat Dates eight pair, of Jujubes twelve pair, of Sebeſtens ten pair, of Raiſins of the Sun ſtoned three Ounces. Strain it, and let the Patient take a large Draught of this Broth two or three times a day.</hi> For the farther tempering of the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Blood, it is alſo very good for this ſort of Conſumptive Perſons, that are troubled with Obſtructions, to uſe prepared <hi>Coral, Wood-lice, Pearl, Crabs-eyes prepared, the ſimple Pouder
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59580:87"/>
of Crabs-claws,</hi> and other ſuch-like Teſtaceous Medicines, which muſt be taken in a good quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and often in a day. As for Example:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Cordial Milk-water, Carduus-water, or Black-Cherry-water a pint, of ſmall Cinnamon-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter half a pint, of prepared Pearl half an Ounce, of Loaf-Sugar two Ounces; mix them, and make a Julep,</hi> of which let the Patient take a quarter of a Pint (ſhaking the Bottle firſt) three or four times a day, adding (if his Stomack ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it) an Ounce or two of <hi>Epidemick-water, Aqua Mirabilis, Dr. Stephens</hi>'s, or ſome other <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous Water.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take Wood-lice prepared, Crabs-eyes prepared, the ſimple Pouder of Crabs-claws, red Coral, of each a Dram, of the Pouder of white Amber half a Dram.</hi> Mix them, and divide them into nine Papers, of which let him take one three times a day in a Spoonful of the Pearl Julep juſt now deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, or of ſome other ſuch-like Julep, drinking a Draught after it. Fifthly, If the Patient ſhould ſeem to be plainly free from Obſtructions of his Liver, and ſo be neither in an Hydropical, nor an Icterical ſtate; but yet the Milk Diet before deſcribed ſhould not be very convenient, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a Looſeneſs, and the Acid Ferment of the Stomack, beſides the altering Medicines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſcribed, for the farther tempering of the ſharpneſs of the Humours, the plentiful uſe of a Compound diſtilled <hi>Milk-water, Capon-water, Snail-water, Pig-water,</hi> &amp;c. may be enjoyned with Advantage, of which I ſhall in the next place give ſome Preſcriptions.</p>

Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Putrid Fever ariſing from the Purulent Matter in the Lungs, muſt be relieved. Fourthly, and laſtly, we muſt help thoſe troubleſome Symptoms ariſing from the Putrid Fever by the Colliquation; that the Patient, if he does dye, may at leaſt obtain an eaſie paſſage out of this World.</p>

                     <note place="margin">What we must give with reſpect to the Lungs.</note>As for what concerns the firſt, the Medicines proper in this degree of the Conſumption, are ſuch as are Altering, Expectorating, and Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamick

As for Example:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take the old Conſerve of Red Roſes preſs'd through a Sieve, of Wood-ſorrel, Leucatellus's Balſam, of each an Ounce.</hi> Mix them, and make an Electuary, of which let him take the quantity of a Nutmeg in Wafers Morning and Evening.

So long as the Inflammation laſts this Fever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly remains, and many times puts a ſudden and unexpected end to the Patient's Life, being attended with the ſucceſſions of a Chilneſs, that comes at uncertain times, and a great Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with Watchings, Reſtleſsneſs, Light-headed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Shortneſs of Breath, a difficult Expecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and with violent and wandring Pains of the Side, Breaſt, and Shoulders.

of Meconium an Ounce and half.</hi> Mix them, and make a <hi>Linctus,</hi> to be taken out of a Spoon, or with a Liquorice-ſtick, when the Cough is troubelſome, ſwallowing of it gently.</p>
                     <p>Likewiſe <hi>Aqua Mirabilis,</hi> becauſe it is Aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and Carminative, being mixt with Pectoral Syrups, and taken down gently, is proper to quiet the Cough. Or,</p>

                  <p>Yea, ſometimes alſo it is not only the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but likewiſe the Phyſician himſelf that uſes to be the occaſion of this Conſumption; to wit, when being greedy of Gain, and a little preſent Fame, he does in a perfunctory manner, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a due Method and neceſſary Evacuations, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuppreſs than root out the Ferment of the preceding Diſeaſe; whereupon the Patient, not being ſo much cured, as tranſlated from one Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper to another, after ſome ſpace of time ſpent in a ſickly ſtate, falls into an Acute and Deplorable Conſumption.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">This is the moſt common Conſumption.</note>And indeed this kind of Conſumption (as far as I have been able to obſerve) is the moſt common of all others; and where we ſee one Original Conſumption of the Lungs, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends meerly upon an alteration of the Blood prediſpoſing the Patient to it, there are five (and it may be ten) to be found, which proceed from Crapulous and Intermitting Fevers, from the Small-Pox, Meaſles, Scarlet Fevers, a Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſie, Peripneumony, Melancholy, and Hyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick Affections; from the Kings-Evil, Scurvy, Green-Sickneſs, Aſthma, Spitting of Blood, Stones in the Lungs, and ſometimes alſo in the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys and Bladder; from the <hi>French-Pox,</hi> Gout, ſtoppage of the Monthly Purgations, of Iſſues, a <hi>Gonorrhoea,</hi> and of Old Ulcers, eſpecially ſuch as are Fiſtulous and Scrophulous.</p>

And there is ſome variation to be made in the Cure proportionate to the different Nature of the Diſtemper.

                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is very fr quent</note>I Shall ſpeak of this kind of Conſumption in the firſt place, becauſe it occurs moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in our Practice: For I remember more of this kind of Conſumptive Patients that I have cured, or at leaſt have ſeen cured by others, than of any other ſort.</p>
                  <p>For in a Scrophulous Conſumption the Blood, by reaſon of its preternatural Acrimony, being as it were coagulated, and ſo unable perfectly to unite the new Chyle to it ſelf, and the ſolid parts, is wont to throw it in a greater quantity than is convenient upon the Glandulous Parts, where the ſmall Veſſels do not run in a right Line as in the Muſcles, but ſpirally; from whence it comes to paſs, that the Blood is wont to make a longer ſtay, and to ſtagnate longer in theſe, than in other parts, and ſo to make a more plentiful ſeparation of the Nutritious Juice in them; whereby it comes to paſs, that theſe parts are apt to ſwell more, and to grow larger, and harder than others. And what happens in other Glandulous parts, happens alſo in the Lungs themſelves, which are every where full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Glandules, but of ſome more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous ones upon the Wind-pipe, and the branches of it, though in their Natural ſtate they are not ſo eaſily diſcerned: So that 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if thoſe that have the <hi>Kings-Evil,</hi> who are frequenlty ſubject to Glandulous Swellings in
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59580:101"/>
other parts, are likewiſe many times affected with ſuch kind of Tubercles, even in the Lungs themſelves, the ſubſtance of which is Naturally ſpongy, and apt to receive the Serous Particles of the Blood, that are here plentifully ſeparated by their continual agitation. And indeed from theſe ſixt Swellings in the Lungs this Scrophulous Conſumption is wont to proceed: The moſt certain Diagnoſtick Sign of which is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from Glandulous Swellings in the External Habit of the Body accompanying of it,<note place="margin">The Diagno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick ſign of it.</note> or at leaſt preceding it; as alſo from an <hi>Ophthalmy</hi> and Scab, that often return, and from other ſuch-like Scrophulous Affections. Though I think I muſt freely confeſs, that ſometimes it happens ſo that the Glandules of the Lungs only, and no others are affected with this Humour. In which caſe there is need of an Experienced and Judicious Phyſician to find out the peculiar Nature of this Conſumption from what yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to be ſpoken under this Head</p>
                  <p>Therefore here we muſt particularly obſerve,<note place="margin">The Tubercles here are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick;</note> That theſe Tubercles of the Lungs (as Scrophu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Swellings in other parts) are either crude and phlegmatick, and ſo no ways diſpoſed to an Inflammation and Maturation:<note place="margin">Or more hot.</note> Or elſe more hot, which will be ſeized with an Inflammation ſooner or later, according to the preſent diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Blood, and the different Nature of the Matter that is contained in the <hi>Cyſtis.</hi> For ſometimes, to wit, when the Matter is concocted, and hardned into a Chalky, or Steatomatous Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or into the ſubſtance of a <hi>Meliceris,</hi> (which it moſt commonly is) the Inflammation, and the Exulceration, that proceeds from thence, are not only ſome conſiderable time before they happen, but likewiſe when they do, they
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:59580:102"/>
are very ſlow, Chronical, and almoſt inſenſible. But whenever the Blood,<note place="margin">When the Matter is of a hot Nature, the Swellings are apt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame.</note> and the Matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the <hi>Cyſtis</hi> are of a Nature different from this (which alſo ſometimes, though ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, happens) the Swellings are very apt to be inflam'd, ſo to ſuppurate, and to turn to an Ulcer. And from hence ariſes the difference in Scrophulous Conſumptions: For ſome (to wit, whenever the Swellings are crude, and not apt to be inflam'd) in a Conſumptive ſtate live, though they are crazy and ſickly, from their Childhood till they are old, with a Cough that is almoſt continual, and troubles them both Night and Day, Summer and Winter, with a weight in their Breaſt, with a difficult, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Aſthmatical Reſpiration, but yet without any ſenſible Fever; but upon the taking of the leaſt Cold (to which alſo they are more ſubject than other People) they are wont to ſpit a great deal of Phlegmatick and Serous Matter. Theſe People may be preſerved from any dangerous, or fatal Effects of their Diſtemper, even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Phyſick, only by ordering themſelves regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in thoſe Six Things, which we call Non-natural. And hence it comes to paſs, that they ſeldom deſire the Help of a Phyſician in this ſickly crazy ſtate, being better contented to live Miſerably,<note place="margin">A Scrophu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is curable, when the Tubercles are crude.</note> than Phyſically. But for my part I do not queſtion, but by the frequent changing of Air, and making choice of ſuch as is thin and clear, and by the long uſe of <hi>Balſamick,</hi> and <hi>Mercurial</hi> Medicines, of <hi>Wood-lice, Chalybeates,</hi> but eſpecially the <hi>Mineral Waters,</hi> and of other Antiſcrophulous Remedies, theſe Swellings may be waſted in the Lungs as well as in other parts, and ſo the Patient may be freed from a Scrophu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and Conſumptive ſtate, as I have often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="197" facs="tcp:59580:102"/>In the Cure of this kind of Conſumption,<note place="margin">A Milk Diet is not to be uſed in the Cure of it.</note> we muſt by no means put them upon the uſe of a Milk Diet; becauſe it is wont to promote and increaſe the Obſtructions and Swellings, that proceed from a Viſcous Humour. Likewiſe thoſe Pectoral Medicines, that are commonly called Expectoratives and Opiates, do no great good in this caſe, unleſs it be upon the taking of new Cold, to mitigate the Symptoms that ariſe from it, as a Cough, Fever, difficulty of Breathing, want of Sleep; and that only whilſt all, or ſome of theſe do yet remain in a great degree, and violent.</p>
                  <p>But whenever theſe Tubercles are of a hotter Nature,<note place="margin">When the Tubercles are hot, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is Acute.</note> and thereupon more ſubject to a quick Inflammation and Exulceration, this Scrophulous, Conſumption is very Acute, and terminates in a few Months; and as to the manner of Cure, differs but little from a common Conſumption. Neither are we to make any other Prognoſtick in this than in another Conſumption; to wit, that it differs in the event according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and progreſs of the Diſeaſe, as I have ſaid before.</p>
                  <p>I have many times obſerved this kind of Acute Conſumption to proceed from the ſtopping and drying up of a Scrophulous Scab;<note place="margin">The Occaſion of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</note> as the other more Chronical Conſumption is wont to ſeize upon thoſe that have been ſubject to cold Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of the Glands.<note place="margin">What is to be done in the hot Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</note> In the beginning of theſe more hot Swellings, liberal and frequent Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is for the moſt part more neceſſary than in other Conſumptions; by which means the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation and Suppuration of the Tubercle may perhaps be prevented, though the incipient Tumour, that is begun to ariſe, may neither be leſſened, nor perfectly waſted. Here alſo it is
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:59580:103"/>
convenient to add your Figwort, Dropwort, Wood-lice, and other Antiſcrophulous Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents to the Pulmonary Medicines. Here like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Gums and Balſams are very ſerviceable: As alſo my Balſamick Pills before mentioned, by a long uſe of which I have done more towards the perfect Cure of very many of this kind of Conſumptive Patients than by any other Pulmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Medicines.<note place="margin">When they Apoſtemate, Specificks do no good.</note> But if theſe hot Swellings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin once to turn to an Apoſteme, Specificks then do no good at all; but ſuch kind of Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Patients muſt be treated in the ſame manner as other Conſumptive Perſons, to wit, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the degree and progreſs of the Diſeaſe.</p>

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:59580:103"/>
government and care in thoſe ſix things we call non-natural, have followed their ordinary Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. But upon committing of the leaſt Error either in the quantity or quality of their Food, or in the time of Eating and Drinking, much more upon a Debauch, and the liberal drinking of Spirituous Liquors, or upon the getting of Cold, they are very ſubject to Putrid Fevers, and ſo long as they laſt the Patient's Life is in danger; and the Lungs being heated ſuffer more Injury from thence in a Week, than otherwiſe they would do in a Year. For the Fever that ſeizes this kind of Conſumptive Perſons, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the proper Nature of the Tubercles, is Acute. But though in the beginning that, or even the Cough, and other Symptoms of the Lungs ſeem to be mild, and though the Habit of the Body be never ſo much emaciated, we muſt bleed them moderately, and (if there be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) we muſt repeat it at the firſt Invaſion of the Fever; and with all the Medicines we uſe for the Fever, we muſt mix ſuch Pectoral and Antiſcrophulous Ingredients as are proper; by which means I have with the Bleſſing of God recovered one and the ſame Conſumptive Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (as Mr. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and a certain Merchant in <hi>Philpot-Lane,</hi> with many others) from ſeveral Putrid Fevers, that have returned the ſame Year; and that without any great miſchief occaſioned to the Lungs by them. But the oftner theſe Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers return, ſo much the ſooner does the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption quicken its pace towards a fatal end; and the nearer the Conſumptive Perſon is to this Fatal Day, the oftner are theſe Putrid Fevers apt to return, ariſing from the leaſt occaſion: The Inflammation of any new Tubercle (as it ſeems to me) always giving the occaſion of this kind

                     <p>Of a Scorbutical Conſumption.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">There is a Colliquative Ferment in all Scurvies.</note>IN all Scurvies, but eſpecially that which is Saline, the Blood always has in it a Ferment, which cauſes a great Colliquation, and likewiſe Secretion of the Chylous <hi>Lympha</hi> in the Glands; but eſpecially in thoſe that are ſeated about the Mouth, Jaws, and Lungs; and from hence it comes to paſs that this kind of Patients, as they are ſubject to great Sweating, and to make much Urine, ſo likewiſe to a continual ſpitting by the Salivatory Ducts, to a hawking up of tough Phlegm from the Tonſils, and to a frequent Cough, proceeding from a continual ſpewing out of a <hi>Serous</hi> Liquor by the Glandulous Coat of the Wind-pipe. But this Scorbutical <hi>Lympha,</hi> that is excern'd by the Tonſils and the other Glands, though it admits of ſome Concoction, yet (as it abounds with a fixt Salt, and is in its own proper Nature glutinous) it has always ſome toughneſs;<note place="margin">The Cough in a Scorbutical Conſumption is not vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</note> and hereupon the Cough of this kind of Conſumptive Perſons, though it be continual, yet is not ſo violent and dry as it uſes to be in others, where the <hi>Serum,</hi> that is thrown out by the Glandules is thinner; whereupon there ariſes a fierce and troubleſome Cough from the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual ſpewing out of that <hi>Serum</hi> by the Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe; or at leaſt a perpetual tickling moleſts them from the ſwelling of its Glandulous Coat, whenever the <hi>Lympha</hi> does not find a convenient paſſage out of the Glandules; and from hence
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:59580:105"/>
for the moſt part there ariſes a violent and dry Cough. From whence it comes to paſs that in a Scorbutical Conſumption, by reaſon of the viſcouſneſs of the Matter that is ſeparated, by which the Coat of the Wind-pipe, and of the branches of it, is rather troubleſomly beſmeared, than irritated, the Patient is not ſo much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to Cough, as he makes a Cough of his own accord to bring up the Phlegm that ſticks, and is troubleſome to him;<note place="margin">But Aſthma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical.</note> and hereupon this kind of Cough comes near to the Nature of an Aſthmatical Cough, and is attended with a greater Wheeſing, difficulty of Breathing, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction, and weight of the Lungs, than we uſe to obſerve in other Conſumptions.<note place="margin">This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is very Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical.</note> And from hence alſo a Scorbutical Conſumption proves very Chronical, and never threatens a ſudden Fatality without a ſpitting of Blood, or ſome other great Symptom coming upon it.</p>
                  <p>This kind of Conſumptive Patients,<note place="margin">Every little Error makes theſe Patients Feveriſh.</note> though they ſpin out their Life to ſome length without any Medicines, only by a due government and care in thoſe ſix things, called non-natural, yet they live ſickly, and upon committing the leaſt Error in their Diet, or taking of Cold, they are wont to be Feveriſh, and to loſe their Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack.</p>
                  <p>The Signs, that preſage this Conſumption,<note place="margin">The ſigns of this Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</note> are eſpecially two; to wit, a frequent eruption of Spots ſcattered up and down upon the whole Skin like the Miliary Shingles, and a perpetual hawking up, but eſpecially in a Morning, of Phlegm, that is ſalt, and troubleſome, thrown out by the Tonſils, which is many times accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with an Exulceration, and waſting of the Gums.</p>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Antiſcorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks must be mixt with the Pectoral Medicines.</note>Thirdly, Antiſcorbuticks muſt always be mixt with the Pectoral Medicines, that at the ſame time, when the flux of colliquated Matter is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectorated with the help of the Pectoral Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, the Ferment, that cauſes this Colliqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may be deſtroyed, or at leaſt abated by the Vertue of Antiſcorbuticks. Otherwiſe ſo long as the Cauſe is not taken away, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper it ſelf cannot admit of a perfect Cure: But we muſt make choice of the milder ſort of Antiſcorbuticks, ſuch as may cauſe the leaſt heat and diſorder in the Blood; as <hi>Water-creſſes, Brook-lime, Pine-tops, the Leaves of Tun-hoof, red Dock-roots, Male Piony-roots,</hi> &amp;c. of which a Bag may be made to be hung in Ale for ordinary Drink: By which means the Volatile Salt of the Simples (in which the Energy of the Medicine conſiſts) is better

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> a Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> that had been a Scorbutical and Hypochondriacal Man, lived almoſt from his Youth to the Seventieth Year of his Age in a Conſumptive ſtate, doing his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs well enough by taking care, and rightly managing himſelf without the help of Phyſick, till he was above Sixty Years old, from which time being very much emaciated he was very often ſubject to a Catarrhous Cough, that was alſo ſomething Aſthmatical, to a want of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, eſpecially in the Winter, and likewiſe to a light Peripneumonical Fever from a ſlow In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of the Tubercles of his Lungs: From which he was eaſily freed by the Advice of a Phyſician. He alſo had three Sons, all which, though they were Scorbutical and Hypochondria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal by Inheritance, yet they ſeemed ſtrong and luſty even to the Thirtieth Year of their Age. About which time they were all one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeized by the ſame Right of Inheritance with a Conſumption occaſioned by Paſſions of the Mind, and the drinking of Spirituous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors; from whence it came to paſs, that by reaſon of their neglect of a due Government, this Diſtemper (which was ſo Chronical in the Father) was Acute enough in his Sons; and (if I well remember) carried them all off before the emaciated Old Man dyed.</p>
                     <p>One of theſe Sons, to wit, the Eldeſt, after he had continued his Hectical Heat for ſome Years by Cares and Drinking, falling into a want of Appetite, Thirſtineſs, a dry Cough, and heavy Oppreſſion in his Breaſt, committed himſelf to my care.</p>

two follow the lamentable Fate of her Husband let her be never ſo diligent in the uſe of the beſt Medicines of the Shops that I had any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of, unleſs the extraordinary heat of the Blood and Lungs could be extinguiſht by a great plenty of ſome diluting and temperating Liquor, which would obtund the ſharp Salts of her Blood, and open the Obſtructions of the Nerves at the ſame time. And therefore after a light Ventilation by taking away a little Blood, I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her (becauſe her Body had been coſtive) <hi>Ebiſham</hi> Waters made into Poſſet-drink, by way of Preparative; and afterwards, that ſhe ſhould drink <hi>Sadler</hi>'s Waters at <hi>Iſlington,</hi> the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Vertue of which to extinguiſh a Hectical Heat, I had that very Year with great Succeſs found in my ſelf, as well as in ſeveral others. I ordered likewiſe a Pearl Julep, her Faintneſs, and the heat of her Blood and Spirits requiring it. But by reaſon of the ſickneſs and weakneſs of her Stomack, ſhe could not take any Linctuſes, or Pectoral Apozemes, much leſs Balſamick Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines. And becauſe of her great difficulty of Breathing, I was very doubtful of the uſe of Opiates. And thus for the preſent I left her.

But ſhe wholly abſtain'd from, and was plainly afraid of uſing the <hi>Iſlington</hi> Waters, becauſe that was the firſt Year they were found out, and there were a great many Reports ſpread abroad of their Miſchievous Nature. But one time when I was not ſent for, going to viſit her

in her Chamber, to know certainly what Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the <hi>Chalybeate</hi> Waters had had, becauſe I had heard nothing either from her, or from her Brother the Apothecary; I found her in a worſe condition than ever before, and her Fever, Cough, and Atrophy, with all the other ill Symptoms before mentioned, ſo much increaſed by a Looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that was come upon her, and had now continued ſo long, that ſhe could hardly riſe out of her Bed. But at laſt being prevailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Reaſons, and the Experience that I urged I had lately had of them, ſhe conſented to try the Vertue of <hi>Iſlington</hi> Waters. And in order thereunto, I ordered a Doſe of my Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and Opiate Electuary to be given every Night for her preſent Looſeneſs, when it was neceſſary; and the next Morning always to drink a Quart, three Pints, two Quarts, five Pints, three Quarts of the Waters in Bed; and likewiſe for her preſent uſe a little warm'd, becauſe of the coldneſs of that time of the Year (for it was paſt the middle of <hi>September</hi>) and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the uſe of them a Month, if they did but paſs well by Urine, and not work or go off by Stool; and that ſhe ſhould be of good Courage if her Appetite began to return, and her Thirſt, with the other Symptoms of her Fever were abated upon the uſe of them; but if it happened otherwiſe, that ſhe ſhould let me know it, that I might preſently do what I could to help her. But being hindred by a great deal of Buſineſs, I heard no more of her till three Weeks after, ſhe and her Brother came to me as I was in my Study, ſhe being now plainly free from her Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Cough, and Weakneſs, and perfectly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from her Conſumption to a Miracle; and making no more complaint but of too great a

greedineſs of her Appetite, which yet I promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to reduce to a moderation, as ſoon as ſhe had got up the Fleſh, which ſhe had loſt, by the long uſe of good Nouriſhment, the truth of which ſhe found by Experience in a ſhort time. Neither did I preſcribe any Medicine, but only that ſhe ſhould uſe a Diet-drink made with Antiſcorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and Pectoral Ingredients the ſpace of a Month for her ordinary Drink. With which ſhe recovered her perfect Health, and is yet alive, and continues well at her Father Mr. <hi>Minakin</hi>'s Houſe, at the Sign of the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Head</hi> in St. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins,</hi> near <hi>Alderſgate.</hi>

                     <p>Of an Aſthmatical Conſumption.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THough every Scorbutical Conſumption is of an Aſthmatical Nature, yet by this I eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially underſtand that, which proceeds from a true Aſthma as the preceding Cauſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends wholly upon it.<note place="margin">Every Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma has a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to a Conſumption.</note> For every Aſthma, but eſpecially that which is Humeroſe, has a tendency to a Conſumption; becauſe in this Diſtemper not only the Lungs are very often ſtraitned, and drawn together in the Nature of Spaſms (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Tone of them is wont to be injured and deſtroyed, and a thick viſcid Humour is wont to be preſt out of their ſubſtance into the branches of the Wind-pipe by that frequent compreſſion, which ſticking faſt there, cauſes a Cough, Whee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and difficulty of Breathing) but likewiſe from the previous diſpoſition of the Blood to be viſcid and tenacious, the Lungs are almoſt always knotted from the very beginning of this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; which Knots or Tubercles in progreſs of time are wont to be inflam'd and exulcerated; from whence there follows a true and fatal Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Conſumption.<note place="margin">How this Conſumption is diſtinguiſht from others.</note> But this Conſumption is to be diſtinguiſhed from others eſpecially by this, that it is accompanied through the whole courſe of the Diſeaſe with a Wheeſing, and extream difficulty of Breathing, becauſe the Humour, that is continually preſt out of the Tubercles and ſubſtance of the Lungs into the Wind-pipe, and branches of it (as I hinted before) is always
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:59580:110"/>
thick and viſcid, ſticking tenaciouſly and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſomly to the ſides of the Wind-pipe and its branches like Glew, and ſo hindring the free paſſage of the Air.</p>
                  <p>But this Conſumption,<note place="margin">This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is very Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical.</note> though it is uſually Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and Incurable, yet in its own Nature it is very Chronical; ſo that I have ſeen ſome, who, though they have been in an Aſthmatical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, yet have lived ſeveral Years with the help of a due Government, and of a thin Air. The cauſe of which thing ſeems to me to be the toughneſs and viſcidity of the Humour thrown out by the Lungs in this Conſumption. For this Humour, by reaſon of the great quantity of Salt contained in it, eaſily and quickly admitting ſome concoction, though into a viſcid Matter, loſes a great deal of its corroſive Acrimony; and thereupon becomes more benign, leaving a leſs impreſſion behind it upon the Lungs, than where it is ſharp, thin, and perfectly crude, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of no Concoction at all.<note place="margin">Old Age is ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</note> And indeed Old Age ſeems to me to be this kind of Chronical and Incurable Conſumption; becauſe all Old Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that are not ſeized with ſome Acute Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, languiſhing in this manner with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, do at length come to the period of their Lives, but not without ſuch fore-runners, as a Chronical Cough, a difficulty of Breathing, a waſted lean Habit of Body, and ſomething of a Hectick Diſpoſition. And we need not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at it, when the ſmall Fibres of the Subſtance of the Lungs, by reaſon of a great Age loſing their tenſneſs, are wont to fall together; from whence it comes to paſs, that the whole Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Lungs grows ſlabby like a Quag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, from the Nutritious Juice being ſeperated, and ſtagnating there; and upon that there is
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:59580:111"/>
that plenty of viſcid Phlegm, a Wheeſing, Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical ſtuffing of the Lungs, difficulty of Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, an emaciation of the whole Body, and a Hectical Diſpoſition. And why ſhould I uſe many words, wh n there follows plainly a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of Old Age?</p>

                     <p>Mrs. <hi>Sherwin,</hi> a Virgin, that had been for many Years paſt troubled with an Aſthma, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Winter, and when ſhe lived in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> with the help of a due Government, of the Country Air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhe ſeemed to do her Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs well enough, till ſhe was Forty Years old, or there-abouts. From which time ſhe began to be ſomewhat Conſumptive, with an increaſe of her Cough, and her difficulty of Breathing grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worſe and worſe every day, her Appetite likewiſe being ſpoiled from her Feveriſh Hectick Heat, which then began to ſeize her. But with uſing the <hi>Chalybeate</hi> Waters, my Stomack-Pills, my Balſamick Pills, and other Pectoral Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines (the Country Air likewiſe contributing very much) for two or three Years ſhe ſeemed much relieved, and almoſt perfectly recovered.

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:59580:112"/>

                     <p>The ſame I obſerved in Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Citizen of <hi>London;</hi> who from a Chronical Aſthma fell at laſt into a fatal Conſumption, of which he was much, and a long time relieved with the uſe of Spirit of Salt Armoniack, and Pectoral Medicines, but eſpecially Balſamicks; but after a Year or two, his difficulty of Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being very much increaſed, and having a Looſeneſs come upon it, together with the Gripes, a Dropſie, and other Symptoms of a fatal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, he was carried off.

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of a Conſumption proceeding from Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, as alſo from an Hyſterical and Hypochondriacal Affection.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>ANY one, that has been but a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Practice of Phyſick,<note place="margin">Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driacal and Hyſterical Perſons are often Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive for a long time, and at last dye of it. The Reaſon why it is ſo</note> may eaſily obſerve, that thoſe that are Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driacal and Hyſterical, do often live a long time in a Conſumptive ſtate, and at length being ſeized with thoſe Symptoms of a Conſumption of the Lungs, that accompany the laſt and fatal degree of it, they dye. The reaſon of which thing may be eaſily gathered from the Principles which I have already mentioned. For in an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriacal and Hyſterical Affection, the Brain, and the whole Syſtem of the Nerves are always diſtempered; and thereupon not only the Animal Spirits do degenerate into a Windy and unquiet Nature, but alſo the whole Maſs of Blood, which ought to be duly actuated and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigorated by thoſe Spirits, is turned into a crude and cachectical load. And indeed we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to wonder that a Conſumption does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways follow, where there is ſuch a deſtruction of the Tone of the Nerves, and from ſuch a diſpoſition of the Spirits and Blood. Moreover every one knows that ſome troubleſome Paſſions of the Mind do for the moſt part precede, or at leaſt accompany an Hyſterical, and an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriacal Affection. From which (as I have
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:59580:113"/>
already obſerved in the beginning of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe) a Conſumption is wont oftner to take its Original, than from Cold, or any other Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. Beſides thoſe that are Hyſterical and Hypochondriacal from Fear and Anxious Thoughts, are very often ſubject to continual Suffocations, and Oppreſſions of their Breaſt (which are nothing but Spaſmodick contractions of the Muſcles of the Breaſt and <hi>Larynx,</hi> and of the tender Subſtance of the Lungs) whereupon their Tone being once weakned and deſtroyed, no Body can think it ſtrange if there often fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows a Conſumption.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is for the most part Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, yet fatal.</note>But this Conſumption for the moſt part is Chronical, becauſe it depends upon a morbid diſpoſition of the Spirits, and Humours contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by degrees: But yet for the moſt part it is Mortal, not only becauſe they are ſeldom frighted at it by reaſon of the inſenſible Progreſs of it, until the Patient, that had been a long time ſickly, falls at laſt into a deep Conſumption; but alſo becauſe the ſtock of Humours, upon which this kind of Conſumption depends, is plainly not to be exhauſted.<note place="margin">How it is diſtinguiſht from other Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> This Conſumption may be diſtinguiſht from other Conſumptions eſpecially by an Oppreſſion of the Breaſt, and an unuſual Sadneſs of the Mind; as alſo by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Hyſterical Choakings, Faintings, and other Nervous Symptoms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Cure is almost the ſame as the general Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. But the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Spirits and Cepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks must be given more plentifully in this Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</note>The Cure is not to be altered much from the General Method. Yet I will ſubjoyn ſome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations concerning it. Firſt, In this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, becauſe the great Weakneſs, and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Nerves require it, we muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, if not even enjoyn, a more liberal uſe of <hi>Spirit of Harts-horn, Spirit of Salt Armoniack, Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Caſtor, Hyſterical Water,</hi> and <hi>Compound
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59580:113"/>
Piony-water,</hi> and other things of that Nature, than we uſe to do in other Conſumptions; the extraordinary Efficacy of which in relieving the Symptoms of this kind of Conſumptive Perſons, I have very often found by Experience; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed without theſe neither their Faintneſs, nor Choakings (which are Symptoms that are wont very frequently to affect theſe Patients) nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Cough it ſelf (which in this Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion does for the moſt part proceed from the <hi>Genus Nervoſum</hi>) can be mitigated. Secondly,<note place="margin">The <hi>Chaly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beate</hi> Waters are very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</note> Likewiſe the Mineral Waters are very uſeful in this caſe, and indeed without <hi>Chalybeate</hi> Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, thoſe which are commonly called Pecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Antiphthiſical, do no good. But they muſt be put upon the uſe of this kind of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines in time, before there appear any ſigns of an Ulcer of the Lungs, for fear the Patient ſhould find more hurt than good from them, when Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is once by degrees reduced to ſuch a colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quative ſtate. Thirdly,<note place="margin">Neither a Milk Diet nor Purges are conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</note> As a Milk Diet ſeldom is convenient for this kind of Conſumptive Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, ſo neither for the ſame Reaſons (to wit, the weakneſs of their Nerves, and the preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſourneſs of their Stomacks) do Purges do any good, eſpecially to Hyſterical Women, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they be very gentle, and given in due time. Fourthly, But gentle Vomits,<note place="margin">Gentle Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits are very beneficial.</note> and ſuch as are fitted to the ſtrength of the Patient in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Diſtemper, are wont to help this kind of Conſumptive Perſons to a wonder, by relieving the Brain and Nerves. Fifthly,<note place="margin">Opiates are many times neceſſary.</note> The uſe of <hi>Opium</hi> may not only be allowed by a Phyſician, but many times it appears plainly neceſſary, perhaps more in this, than in any other Conſumption of the Lungs, by reaſon of the grievous Spaſms of the Stomack, Inteſtines,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:59580:114"/>
and other parts, which are wont to happen to this kind of Conſumptive Perſons more than to any others from their pertinacious Watchings, and other Symptoms, by reaſon of the windy and exploſive ſtate of the Animal Spirits, and the delirous activity and working of their Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>

But although he was freed from his Melancholy, yet he continued lean, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing thoughtful, and many times too he was troubled with a little, dry Cough, which he had been ſubject to for a long time.

But in the alternate Succeſſion of the aforeſaid Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, one might eaſily ſee the Patient declining every day, and this Chronical Conſumption, that had been neglected, haſtening to its fatal end, of which I undertook only a palliative Cure.</p>

For a Year or two he did not
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:59580:115"/>
take care to eradicate the Diſeaſe, contenting himſelf with I know not what Receipts of ſome Old Women to help his Cough; till at length having ſome apprehenſion of the approaches of Death from the total loſs of his Appetite, from a difficulty of Breathing, a Cough, Fever, and an univerſal Colliquation coming upon it, he begged my Advice, when it was too late, at the very beginning of the Winter. Becauſe of his difficulty of Breathing, and his troubleſome Cough, I ſent him into the Country Air, and put him upon the uſe of Pectoral and Balſamick Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines; whereupon he ſeemed for a Month or two to be better as to his Appetite, Cough, and Breathing.

of a Hypochondriacal, or Spaſmodick Nature) were plainly overcome. After this for ſome Weeks he continued free from the Spaſmodick Conſtriction and ſtreightneſs of his Lungs, and recovered ſomething of an Appetite, and of his Strength; ſo that I my ſelf began to have a great deal of hopes that he would quickly recover his Health, and thought him to be rather Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriacal, than Conſumptive; till at length the unexpected return of his difficulty of Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, Cough, and the other fatal Symptoms of a Conſumption (of which he dyed at laſt) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged me to alter my Opinion.</p>

                     <p>Mrs. <hi>Walker,</hi> a Merchant's Wife of <hi>London,</hi> about the Thirtieth Year of her Age becoming Hypochondriacal and Hyſterical from many preceding Cares, and Paſſions of her Mind, at length fell into a Hectick Fever, with a Cough, difficulty of Breathing, pain in her Side, and Looſeneſs; which made her extreamly weak, and brought her almoſt into the ſtate of a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſmus.</hi> But with the diligent uſe of Opiates, Hyſterick Juleps, the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Bark, of Pectoral Antiſcorbutick, and <hi>Chalybeate</hi> Medicines, and repeated Bleeding, ſhe was reſtored even in the Winter-time to a ſtate of Health, beyond the expectation of all her Friends.

From which ſhe recovered again in the Spring with the timely uſe of <hi>Iſlington</hi> Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the benefit of the Country Air. From which time ſhe gave her ſelf to the drinking of too much Brandy, and other Spirituous Liquors,

to keep up her Spirits; with the liberal drinking of which, as ſhe plainly loſt her Appetite, ſo at length, that is, after a Year or two, ſhe had a fatal return of her Conſumption that Winter, together with a flaming Hectick Fever, a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Cough, difficulty of Breathing, Looſeneſs, and indeed an univerſal Colliquation. Neither would ſhe ask my Advice until ſhe was hardly able, by reaſon of her Weakneſs, to turn her ſelf in her Bed.

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of a Conſumption cauſed by ſpitting of Blood.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THAT common ſaying amongſt Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, That Purulent Matter follows Blood, ſeems to have had its Original from hence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe an Apoſteme of the Lungs, or a Pulmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Conſumption is wont to follow a ſpitting of Blood ſooner and oftner than any other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper. Which whether it happens from the <hi>Craſis</hi> of the Blood being ſpoyled by too great a loſs of it, or from a plentiful Flux of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours from the whole Habit of the Body into the tender Lungs, where they have a free paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage; or from the Putrefaction of the clotted Blood, that remains in the Lungs after the ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Blood; or laſtly, from ſome Ulcer fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing upon the eroſion of the Veſſels, I do not well know.<note place="margin">A Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion uſually follows a ſpitting of Blood. A Phyſician must endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the one, as well as to cure the other.</note> But this we may almoſt always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that where a ſpitting of Blood has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded, a Conſumption of the Lungs is wont to follow. And therefore a Prudent and Honeſt Phyſician, when he is called to one that ſpits Blood, ought not only to take care of his own Reputation, and the Honour of Phyſick, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Prognoſtick at firſt of the Conſumption that is like to follow, but alſo as far as he is able by neceſſary Cautions, and proper Medicines, to prevent this fatal event of the ſpitting of Blood, as well as to Cure the preſent Diſtemper, at leaſt not to do or attempt any thing in the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:59580:117"/>
Cure of it, that may make the Patient more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to a Conſumption.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">We must di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental and an Habitual Haemoptoë.</note>And here it is neceſſary to diſtinguiſh between an Accidental and Habitual Spitting of Blood. I call that Accidental, which proceeds meerly from ſome Accident; as from Hollowing, or ſpeaking too loud, Exerciſe, or a violent Cough, from the ſuppreſſion of ſome uſual Haemorrhage, from Chalky Stones, that are bred in the Lungs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or from Pins, and any other things that ſlip down into them from without. That I call Habitual, which depends upon a vitiated, ſharp, and fermenting Diſpoſition of the Blood; ſo that the ſtock and fuel of the Diſeaſe always lurks within.<note place="margin">An acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Haemoptoë ſeldom ends in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</note> That Accidental ſpitting of Blood, as it ſeldom returns when it is cured after letting of Blood, a due ordering of their Diet, and the uſe of proper Medicines; ſo though the Bleeding has been profuſe and plentiful, yet it ſeldom ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates in a Conſumption; but the Patient be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once by degrees freed, with a due manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment recovers his freſh Colour, and gets his Fleſh, as if he had never been troubled with ſuch a Flux, as it uſually happens after an immoderate Flux of the <hi>Menſes,</hi> and other Fluxes of that kind.

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:59580:117"/>
time after another to be opened, and then there follows a great expenſe of that red Liquor, which for the moſt part does not ſtop till the Feveriſh Orgaſm, and the Inteſtine motion of the Blood depending thereupon, perfectly ceaſes, either with the help of Art, or of its own accord, at leaſt with the leſſening the quantity of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor. And then too there is but a treacherous Truce, until the next time that the Veſſels hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be too much diſtended by the preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral motion of the Blood in the next Fit.<note place="margin">And often ends in a Conſumption.</note> And indeed this is that fatal ſpitting of Blood, which as it is hard to Cure, and often comes unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedly upon the Patient, ſo it has at firſt a Putrid, then a Hectick Fever joyned with it, which is wont very often to terminate in an Incurable and Fatal Conſumption.</p>
                  <p>The Grand Antidote for this ſpitting of Blood is the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Bark,<note place="margin">The <hi>Peruvian</hi> Bark is the great Remedy in this Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moptoë.</note> the extraordinary Vertue of which both to extinguiſh the preſent Feveriſh Efferveſcence of the Blood, and to prevent the return of it, I have always experienced with very great Succeſs, whenever I have made uſe of it for this purpoſe. And as it quickly and ſafely ſtops the preſent ſpitting of Blood,<note place="margin">An Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moptoë cured this way does not end in a Conſumption.</note> and likewiſe prevents it for the future; ſo I never ſee a ſpitting of Blood that was cured this way, end in a Conſumption. For the Flame being in this manner perfectly put out, and the Fever once overcome, the Blood uſes preſently to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver its Natural ſtate, ſo that there cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main the leaſt ſuſpicion of a Conſumption fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing upon it. For a Conſumption, that uſes to follow a ſpitting of Blood, does not ſeem to have its Original ſo much from the breaking or gaping of a ſmall Veſſel, as from the inordinate and Hectical ſtate of the Blood. And therefore
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:59580:118"/>
though a Conſumption uſually follows a ſpitting of Blood, when 'tis cured the common way, that is, by frequent Bleedings, Emplaſtick Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, Opiates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which rather hinder the Eruption of Blood by force, than alter the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſtate of the Blood: Yet no one will won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if the Hectick Flame remaining within does at length throw the Patient into a Conſumption; yet whenever the preſent Orgaſm of the Blood is ſo overcome by repeated bleeding, the uſe of the Temperate Juices, of Aſtringent and Opiate Juleps and Electuaries, and other things of that Nature (which are to be found in another place in the Chapter of a <hi>Haemoptoë,</hi> or ſpitting of Blood) that we have an Opportunity to give the Bark totally to extinguiſh the Feveriſh flame, and to open the Obſtructions, which otherwiſe might occaſion a new Efferveſcence, we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly make not only for the preſent a palliative but a truly, eradicative, and perfect Cure, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt danger of the return of the ſpitting of Blood, or of a Conſumption following upon it. For the flame being in this manner perfectly extinguiſht, the Blood is reduced to its Natural Motion and <hi>Craſis,</hi> whereupon the Appetite pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently returns, the Lungs recover their Natural Motion and Temperament, and the loſs of the Blood is by degrees repaired; until at length the Patient obtains, though by little and little, his former ſtrong and luſty ſtate, and it may be a better than he had before, without the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of a Hectick Heat, or the danger of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption following upon his Bleeding.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">In this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption there are Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bercles in the Lungs.</note>But if either through the Phyſicians neglect, or from the peculiar Conſtitution of the Patient, or from any other cauſe, it ſo happens, that a Conſumption of the Lungs ſucceeds to a ſpitting
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:59580:118"/>
of Blood, the whole Lungs, or at leaſt one of the Lobes, being ſtufft with hard Glandules ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered every where up and down in the form of Tubercles, is much ſwelled. And theſe Tuber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are wont ſooner or later to turn to Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtems, and to be ulcerated, and from thence this Conſumption has its Original, and Progreſs too. But according to the Magnitude and Number of theſe Tubercles,<note place="margin">The Nature of which makes the Conſumption various.</note> and their diſpoſition to a more quick or ſlower putrefaction, this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is very various; ſometimes ſlow, and Chronical; ſometimes quick and Acute, yea, very Acute. For as I have ſeen ſome Perſons that have been in a Conſumption (who have been ſubject to a frequent ſpitting of Blood from the leaſt occaſion) live ſeveral Years with due care and management; doing likewiſe their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, though they have been ſickly, with a Cough, and ſome degree of a difficulty of Breathing; to wit, whenever the Tubercles of the Lungs happen to be few, ſmall, and not apt to putrefie; or whenever the ſpitting of Blood proceeds ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from Stones that are bred in the Lungs, or from ſome external Accident, than from an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine Hectical motion of a hot Fermenting Blood: So I have obſerved others that have been carried off with a quick Death within the ſpace of a few Weeks; and that has been when great Haemorrhages have often returned upon the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient from the Commotion of the Blood boyling vehemently, or when the Tubercles have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taked of ſome malignant Nature, and ſo have been quickly putrified.</p>
                  <p>But whatever this Haemoptoïcal Conſumption has been, whether Acute or Chronical,<note place="margin">This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is one of the most fatal.</note> it has from the common Obſervation of Phyſicians been always reckoned amongſt the number of
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:59580:119"/>
the moſt Fatal and Incurable Conſumptions. But the more Acute it is, the more dangerous it is wont to be. For as the ſpitting of Blood is the firſt occaſion of this Conſumption, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is very apt in the Progreſs of the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to return often, either from the taking of the leaſt Cold, or the committing any Error in their Diet, from Paſſions of the Mind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And every new ſpitting of Blood puſhes on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption to a Fatal end. So that I have often ſeen this kind of Conſumptive Perſons in the very <hi>Haemoptoë,</hi> when it has returned upon them, ſpit out their very Lives in that ſtream of Blood which has come from them. And therefore in the Cure of this Conſumption,<note place="margin">Inciding and Lubricating Medicines are not good in the Cure.</note> Cleanſing, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding, and Lubricating Remedies muſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, or at leaſt uſed very cautiouſly; as alſo hot and penetrating Liniments and Plaiſters, that are outwardly applyed to the Breaſt, to promote Expectoration.<note place="margin">But Incraſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> But we muſt (at leaſt in the beginning of this Diſeaſe, and after every new ſpitting of Blood) rather inſiſt upon the uſe of Alterative, Incraſſating, Agglutinating, and Opiate Medicines; as alſo a <hi>Milk Diet, Solid or Liquid Laudanum, Syrup of Meconium, Syrup of Purſlane, of Marſh-Mallows, of Ground-Ivy</hi> (the plentiful uſe of which in a Conſumption from ſpitting of Blood I would recommend above all other things) <hi>Bole-Armenack, Coral, Dragons-Blood, Lapis Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matites, Gordonius Troches, Troches of Amber:</hi> Of which Electuaries may be made, and Compound Medicines in other forms for the Patient to take. Of which it will be proper to ſpeak more largely in the Chapter of an <hi>Haemoptoë.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in the Progreſs of the Diſeaſe, when once there is not ſo much fear that the ſpitting of Blood will return, we may more ſafely anſwer
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:59580:119"/>
the Indications of the Diſeaſe, with the cautious uſe of Lubricating and Expectorating Medicines. Likewiſe Balſamick Medicines are here of great uſe; as the <hi>Balſamick Syrup, Balſam of Tolu, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pivi, of Peru, Leucatellus Balſam, or Opobalſam, Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam of Sulphur Terebinthinate, and Aniſate, my Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamick Pills,</hi> and other forms compounded of theſe Medicines, the manner of giving of which is to be learnt from what has been already ſaid in the General Method of Cure. Alſo Iſſues, and ſhaving of the Head are very Advantageous in this Conſumption.</p>
                  <p>But above all, I muſt,<note place="margin">The beſt thing in the Cure of this Conſumption is the <hi>Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi> Bark.</note> from the long Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience I have had of it, commend in this Acute and Dangerous Conſumption from a ſpitting of Blood, the uſe of the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Bark, to be given in that form, which is moſt grateful to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. By the frequent and ſufficient repetition of which we may expect to temper the Feveriſh Heat, and to ſuppreſs the Inteſtine motion of the Blood, and ſo conſequently to prevent the return of the <hi>Haemoptoë,</hi> and the Progreſs of the Conſumption, more than with a Milk Diet, with Aſſe's Milk, or a Magazine of Pectoral Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.</p>
                  <p>But in a Chronical and ſlow Conſumption,<note place="margin">In this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption when 'tis ſlow the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeate</hi> Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</note> or rather a Conſumptive ſtate from a ſpitting of Blood, (where the heat of the Blood from the Inteſtine motion of it does not uſe to be ſo great) the <hi>Chalybeate</hi> Mineral Waters are of great uſe, if they are drank every day for a long time, but yet in a ſmall quantity. They muſt be order'd to be taken thus in a little quantity, and to be drank lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurely every day, leſt a too great and ſudden diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the tender Veſſels of the Lungs, cauſed by drinking a great quantity of Water at a time, ſhould bring a freſh ſpitting of Blood. But the ſmall
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:59580:120"/>
quantity of Water that is drank at a time muſt be made up by the length of the time that is every Year deſigned for the drinking of thoſe Waters. By which means likewiſe the Blood perhaps is more tempered and altered, than by drinking a great quantity in a ſhorter ſpace of time.</p>

                     <p>One of the Maſters in the Hoſpital of <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> that had committed himſelf to my care a Year or two before, when he was ſick of a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilential Fever, that went up and down attended with Swellings in the Groin, and Carbuncles (from which Venom perhaps his Blood had not yet ſufficiently purged it ſelf) fell about the 35th. Year of his Age, and in the Year 1669. into a very great <hi>Haemoptoë,</hi> by which he had loſt a great deal of Blood before he ſent for me. But with Bleeding, Ligatures, Aſtringent Juleps and Electuaries, a Milk Diet, and a due Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all things, the Flux was perfectly ſtopt. But yet he ſtill continued Hectical, and was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with an ugly Cough. And therefore I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him to continue his Milk Diet, and to take a Doſe of an Opiate Electuary every Night. And to prevent a Conſumption, that was like to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, I directed an Iſſue to be made in his Arm, his Head to be ſhaved, and the Cephalick Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to be laid upon it; and that the Patient ſhould be ſent into the Country, and into an open Air, and that he ſhould uſe there the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating Juices; to wit, of Plantain and Nettles, at leaſt twice a day, with ſeveral other things, which it is not neceſſary now to give a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Account of. But notwithſtanding all this, his Hectick Heat, and his Cough continually
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:59580:120"/>
troubled him, and his ſpitting of Blood returned by uncertain periods, at leaſt twice a Month, to wit, about the Full and the New of the Moon, from the heat and motion of the Blood being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, the Patient continually waſting more and more with the Fever that followed him, till at length being brought into an univerſal Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquative ſtate with a Looſeneſs, Sweats, a Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and being troubled with a very great difficulty of Breathing, he ended his Life. For at that time I did not know the Vertue of the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Bark, to take off this Hectick Fever, from which that Fatal Colliquation did proceed. The Body being opened, I found the Lungs ſtrangely ſwelled, and every where in all the Lobes full of Tubercles, ſome of which were crude, others ulcerated.</p>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Rookes</hi> in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> being about Forty Years old, from a multitude of Cares and hard Drinking ſeemed to be continually Hectical for Ten Years together, being ſtufft in his Lungs, troubled with a Cough, and enclin'd to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption: And from extraordinary Exerciſe, and exceſs in drinking of Spirituous Liquors, he fell into a very great ſpitting of Blood, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed with a difficulty of Breathing, and a pain in his Breaſt: And the poor Man had it return'd upon him, and that conſiderably, every day, or every other day, for at leaſt three Weeks, and that notwithſtanding frequent Phlebotomy, the uſe of a Milk Diet, of the Tempering Juices, Aſtringent and Opiate Electuaries, and Juleps, and likewiſe of the Royal Styptick Water. But at length when I had obſerved not only by the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:59580:121"/>
quickneſs of his Pulſe, and the high colour of his Urine, but alſo from his very Temper, that a remarkable Fever returning often by uncertain intervals always brought on his ſpitting of Blood, I gave him a Dram of the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Bark in a convenient Draught every four hours: To which I always took care there ſhould be more or leſs <hi>Laudanum</hi> added, according as he could bear it. With the uſe of which I found his Fever taken off without any more to do, and without any return of his ſpitting of Blood, and that his Urine was come to its Natural colour. I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the repeating of the <hi>Cortex</hi> again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain at due intervals, and took care he ſhould have Nouriſhment agreeable to his Appetite (which now was better than it was before he ſpit Blood) and that he ſhould have the benefit of the Country Air. Whereupon (which is ſtrange to be told) without any other help, he came to have a more firm and ſtrong Habit of Body, his Lungs more free, his Breathing more eaſie, the heat of his Blood leſs, and his Cough too more moderate now for a Year and half, than he had found for ſeveral Years before his ſpitting of Blood; his Friends admiring at it, who expected he would certainly dye of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in a little time after his ſpitting of Blood. Which was ſo much the more wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, becauſe he continued as careleſs in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement of himſelf in the ſix non-natural things, as he uſed to be before his <hi>Haemoptoë,</hi> which neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect he at laſt paid for with the loſs of his Life. For with the very great Errors he had lately committed, he fell into a new Conſumption, and that a threatning and fatal one, which at length carried him off. His Body being opened after he was dead, we found the ſubſtance of

the Liver compact and cloſe, as if it had been parboyl'd, all the Lobes of the Lungs moſt fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily ting'd with a black colour (which perhaps was occaſioned by his continual ſmoaking of Tobacco) and every where full of a world of Tubercles, of which ſome that were larger, were full of purulent Matter, others of a ſubſtance like Honey. But the greateſt part of the leſſer ones, which were diſpoſed in Cluſters, and like Grape-ſtones through all the ſubſtance of the Lungs, contained a Steatomatoſe Matter in them. All the Glandules that were ſeated near the Wind-pipe were very black, and had in them a Liquor of a black, or dark colour, ſuch as I have uſually obſerved Scorbutical and Hypochondriacal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that have been Conſumptive, to hawk up out of their Throats in a Morning, eſpecially thoſe that have been uſed to ſmoak much To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, or have lived in an Air that has been filled with the ſmoak of Coals.</p>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Luff,</hi> the Son of that Reverend Divine which I have already mentioned, living in <hi>Milk-ſtreet,</hi> after he had married a Virgin that was Conſumptive (and as I remember, dyed within a Year after ſhe was married, with an univerſal Colliquation, and the other Symptoms of a fatal Conſumption of the Lungs) a few Months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her Death fell into a Conſumption (as I judg'd) by Contagion. To which fatal Diſeaſe an <hi>Haemoptoë</hi> prepared the way, with which he was ſuddenly taken at <hi>Exeter,</hi> and that in the Winter-time, and he loſt a great deal of Blood. But as ſoon as his ſpitting of Blood was ſtopt by Phlebotomy, a Milk Diet, and Incraſſating Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, and he had recovered his ſtrength in ſome meaſure, being diſmiſt by his Country Phyſician, within a Fortnight (which was much ſooner than was fit) he came back to <hi>London</hi> on Horſe-back, and preſently ſent for me. But alas! how much was he changed from what he was before! I found the poor Patient very Feveriſh, and always Coughing, and extreamly waſted with a Colliquation, that was now begun, and troubled with a ſtreightneſs and pains in his Breaſt. I found it to be a mixt Fever, partly Peripneumonick, from a new Inflammation of ſome of the Tubercles; partly Putrid, from the purulency of other Glandules, which had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun ſo ſoon to be ulcerated. I judged the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper to be a very Acute Conſumption of the Lungs from a ſpitting of Blood, which as it was
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:59580:122"/>
contracted by Infection, ſo it was rendred more haſty and violent by his ill Government in his Journey, and his return into our Air, that is filled with the ſmoak of Coals. The violence of the Pain, and Fever requiting it, I preſently ordered a Vein to be opened, but I took away but a little Blood, becauſe of the Conſumption and Colliquation that was upon him. Then I endeavoured at leaſt to ſtave off this haſty Ruin for ſome time with temperate Juleps and Opiates, and all ſorts of convenient Pectoral Medicines, Bliſters, and a due management in all things. But all theſe things were to no purpoſe; for within three or four Weeks he departed this Life, with all the Symptoms of a very Acute Conſumption of the Lungs.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of a Conſumption cauſed by Stones bred in the Lungs, and by things ſlipt down into them from without, as alſo by the Stone in the Kidneys and Bladder.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Chalky ſtones are often bred in the Lungs.</note>I Have often obſerved Chalky Stones bred in the Lungs, which when they have been Angular, and diſturbed with the ſhaking of the Lungs, are wont to tear the tender ſubſtance of thoſe parts; from whence have ariſen a violent and dry Cough, and a horrible pain in the Breaſt, like that in a Pleuriſy and Peripneumony; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo an <hi>Haemoptoë</hi> with a conſiderable Flux of Blood, and from thence Ulcers, with the uſual Signs of a Conſumption of the Lungs. Therefore when theſe horrid Pains happen with an <hi>Haemoptoë</hi> about the beginning of a Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">When we may judge a Conſumption to be from them.</note> we may juſtly ſuſpect it to be a Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Stones in the Lungs. Although we cannot pronounce any thing certain of this thing, till a Stone or two have been cough'd up. For it often happens that theſe Stones paſſing by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees through the Lungs, do at length get into the branches of the Wind-pipe, by which they are cough'd up, and that ſeldom without a great flux of Blood. But if theſe Stones are ſmooth, and not ſuch as may break or tear the ſubſtance of the Lungs, they do not diſpoſe the Patient much to a Conſumption (at leaſt an Acute one;)
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:59580:123"/>
nor indeed do they occaſion any great miſchief more than a dry Cough, that is ſomewhat trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, and ſomething of an oppreſſing weight in the Breaſt, as I have obſerved in ſeveral long ago, in whoſe Lungs, after they have been dead, I have found many of theſe ſmooth Chalky Stones, and ſome of them pretty large, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Tubercle, or Ulcer occaſioned by them:<note place="margin">Where theſe Stones are ſharp they cauſe a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</note> But where theſe Stones have been Angu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and ſharp, and apt to break and tear the Lungs, they have cauſed a Pain, a ſpitting of Blood, Ulcers, and a Conſumption it ſelf, as I have already hinted. In which caſe, as a pain does precede to, and accompany the ſpitting of Blood, ſo a ſpitting of Blood goes before, and accompanies the Ulcers and Conſumption.</p>
                  <p>What I have now ſaid of Stones,<note place="margin">The ſame is true of Nails, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> is likewiſe true of Nails, Pins, and other things, that ſlip down into the Lungs as People laugh. For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they are quickly cough'd up again, they prick the Lungs, and cauſe a lancinating pain, from whence a ſpitting of Blood, Ulcers, and a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption are wont to proceed. Of which I ſhall add a remarkable Hiſtory preſently at the end of this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Ulcers, as alſo the Conſumption,<note place="margin">The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers they cauſe, cannot be cured before they are brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</note> which is the effect of them (which we may likewiſe obſerve of Ulcers in the Kidneys and Bladder) can never be cured without fetching away the Stone, or Nail, or Pin, or whatever elſe it is of that Nature, that breeds the Ulcers. But theſe things, which cauſing a continual pricking in the ulcerated part, did by that means render the Cure of it impoſſible before, being once come away, though it be, as it uſually is with a great Haemorrhage, yet the Ulcer, and Conſumption of the Lungs, that proceed from them, do often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:59580:124"/>
admit of an eaſie and perfect Cure, becauſe they have not their Original ſo much from a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed Habit of the Body, as from a meer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental Diſtemper of one ſingle part. Of which I ſhall relate one or two remarkable Hiſtories at the end of this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Cure of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</note>In the Cure of this kind of Ulcers, Opiate and Balſamick Medicines, with a Milk Diet, are of very great uſe; Opiates to obtund the ſenſe of the torn and ſtimulated parts, and to keep them as quiet as is poſſible, whilſt the Balſamicks exert their Healing Power. And with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual uſe of Milk the Hectick heat of the Blood, contracted in this Conſumptive ſtate, is to be allayed. But although theſe ſharp Stones can neither be made to lye quiet in that part of the Lungs which they occupy, with the plentiful uſe of <hi>Laudanum,</hi> nor brought away with the uſe of Lubricating Medicines, but cauſe an Incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Conſumption, and ſpitting of Blood, and that ſuch a one as returns by uncertain Intervals with a lancinating pain: Yet this Conſumption is in its own Nature ſlow, and very Chronical, as a Conſumption from the Stone in the Kidneys and Bladder uſes to be, and, generally ſpeaking, every Conſumption that depends meerly upon an indiſpoſition or Ulcer of ſome particular part, without an habitual diſpoſition of the Blood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted either by propagation from the Parents, or a long abuſe of the ſix things called non-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural. But whenever a heap, or ſtock of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed Humours does conſpire with ſome ſuch fatal Cauſe, the Conſumption which proceeds from thence, is not only fatal from the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, but alſo quick and very Acute, ſo that it carries off the Patient within a few Months, and it may be Weeks. I ſhall add theſe few
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:59580:124"/>
things concerning the variation of Cure in this kind of Conſumption.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Lubricating Medicines muſt be taken plentifully in the beginning of this Diſtemper; yea, and gentle Vomits; by which means we may endeavour to bring away the Stone, or any other things that have ſlipt down into the Lungs, before they are quite fixt there by their lodging long in the part, and before the Tone of the Lungs is much injured by them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, But if great and ſpaſmodick pains are excited by the tearing of the Lungs, cauſed from the motion of theſe ſharp bodies, we muſt expect a great ſpitting of Blood; and therefore inſtead of Lubricating Medicines we muſt give <hi>Laudanum,</hi> and that in good quantities, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, whereby we may hinder the motion of the Stone for the preſent, abate the pain, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ſpitting of Blood. For in this caſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Blood, outward Fomentations, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niments do no good (as they uſe to do in Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritick and Peripneumonick pains,) and this I found by Experience in one Mr. <hi>Foſter,</hi> and in many others. 'Tis true indeed that a lingring and ſlow Conſumption, attended with a difficulty of Breathing, and other ſuch-like Symptoms will follow from a Stone lying in this manner in the Lungs, which I have often obſerved in my Practice. But yet a lingring and uncertain Conſumption is better than an Acute one, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with horrid pains, that certainly and quickly terminates in Death. For if this kind of Conſumptive People take ſuch care of their Health as to live always in an open and Country Air, to keep from taking of Cold, from Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and too much Exerciſe, and any other thing, that may diſturb the Stones again, that
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:59580:125"/>
are fixt, and lye quiet, they may live to a great Age, and do their Buſineſs well enough.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Sometimes the Bleeding must be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a while.</note>Thirdly, But if there follows a ſpitting of Blood from the tearing of the Lungs, it ought to be let alone for a while. For in this Flux, the Stones, or any other things that have ſlipt down into the Lungs, may be voided. But if the <hi>Haemoptoë</hi> is great and dangerous, we muſt open a Vein, and if it be neceſſary, repeat it; and we muſt give not only Opiate Medicines, but alſo Aſtringents in the form of <hi>Linctuſes, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leps,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>Lapis Haematites,</hi> the <hi>Royal Styptick Water;</hi> we muſt uſe a Milk Diet, and other things briefly mentioned before in the former Chapter, which I ſhall hereafter give a larger Account of in another Book, if I have an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to treat of an <hi>Haemoptoë.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Balſamicks muſt be plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully uſed.</note>Fourthly, But if the Lungs happen to be torn, and to be ulcerated from the motion of the Stone (whether it be voided or not) we muſt make choice of Balſamick Medicines, and give them plentifully; of which I have given ſeveral forms in the General Method of Cure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">A Milk Diet is not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, where there are Stones in the Lungs.</note>Fifthly, we muſt not Order a Milk Diet in a Conſumption proceeding from Stones in the Lungs, unleſs there is a great neceſſity; becauſe it is apt to breed ſome new Chalky Stones: Whereby it comes to paſs, that the Cure of one Conſumption is wont to lay the Foundation of another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The <hi>Chaly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beate</hi> Waters must be drank in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle quantities.</note>Sixthly, Likewiſe the <hi>Chalybeate</hi> Waters, though they may be good in this Conſumption, muſt be drank in a little quantity at a time, for fear the Stone ſhould be ſtir'd again by the too great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtention of the Veſſels of the Lungs. Whereby it comes to paſs, that the return of the pain, and of the ſpitting of Blood does often follow upon it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:59580:125"/>Seventhly,<note place="margin">Sometimes there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Stones.</note> Sometimes there are ſeveral of theſe Stones in the Lungs; ſo that after one or two, or it may be a third has been voided, yet the Lungs are ulcerated by thoſe which remain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and from thence there follows a Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As I remember it happened to Mr. <hi>Pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> and ſome others.</p>
                  <p>But a Conſumption of the Lungs is wont to proceed not only from a Stone in the Lungs,<note place="margin">The Stone, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers of the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys and Bladder do often cauſe a Conſumption.</note> and an Ulcer there following upon it, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe very often from Ulcers, and a Calculous diſpoſition of the Kidneys and Bladder; ſo that I have very often obſerved thoſe that have had the Stone, to dye of a Conſumption. But this Conſumption is alwas lingring, and Chronical; and is to be cured in the ſame manner as an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Conſumption,<note place="margin">How this Conſumption is to be cured.</note> only we muſt avoid thoſe Medicines that irritate the pains of the Stone, as my Balſamick Pills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the <hi>Chalybeate</hi> Waters, which eaſe thoſe pains, muſt be often uſed. For I am apt to think that thoſe who have the Stone, do not fall into a Conſumption ſo often from the long and tormenting pain, as from a want of the due ſecretion of the <hi>Serum,</hi> and an alteration of the Ferment, which ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates it in the Kidneys, following upon it. And therefore in the Cure of this kind of Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we muſt have a regard not only to the Conſumption, by uſing the Pectoral Medicines I have before mentioned, but alſo to the Diſeaſe, which is the cauſe of this Conſumption; to wit, the Stone of the Kidneys and Bladder, by uſing ſuch Medicines as may lubricate the Urinary Paſſages, and expel the Stone, or at leaſt miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the pain.</p>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Plucknet,</hi> being Forty Years old, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, a ſtrong and luſty Man; but one that had for many Years lived irregularly in almoſt all the ſix non-natural things, yet found no other miſchief from it beſides a hesky and dry Cough, which he had now been uſed to for a long time without any great trouble; at length upon hard Riding, and taking of Cold by being very wet with the Rain, he fell into dreadful pains of his Breaſt, that were like the pains in a Pleuriſy; upon which there came a great and long ſpitting of Blood, with a Fever, and a Cough almoſt continually troubling him. I could do no good with External Liniments and Expectorating Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, until I came at length to the uſe of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piates. With which, though he got a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite, and a treacherous Truce, yet he could get no perfect Cure. For as his Cough, ſo the Hectick Fever ſtill continued, with which he every day by degrees pined away, and that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the plentiful uſe of Balſamick and Pectoral Medicines, of Aſſe's Milk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> till at laſt in the ſpace of a Year he appeared in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable Conſumptive ſtate, with an univerſal Colliquation made by the Skin, by Stool, by his Lungs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which Conſumption, that in its own proper Nature was lingring and Chronical, without doubt came to be ſo quick and haſty from a long prediſpoſition of the Humours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by his irregular way of living. And the Fatal Day which concluded his Life, was not a little haſtened, by reaſon he would not, though he took Medicines, ſubmit to any Government during the uſe of them: Whereupon in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:59580:126"/>
ſtate there being ſome new Stones mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved three or four times in his Lungs with hard Riding, Drinking, and often taking of Cold, he found again and again a return of his dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Spaſms, and a long and profuſe ſpitting of Blood. Which continuing upon him, though he cough'd up ſeveral Angular Stones, yet he was ſo much weakned by the Spaſms, and loſt ſo much Blood by his <hi>Haemoptoë,</hi> that he very quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to wit, in the ſpace of a Year, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, ran the whole courſe of this Diſtemper, even to the fatal period of it, as if his Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had been in its own Nature plainly Acute.</p>

For the relieving of which Symptoms we did very little good with Bleeding, external Liniments, and Pectoral Medicines given inwardly; ſo that with the loſs of his Strength and Blood, cauſed by his ſpitting of Blood, and his pains return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almoſt every day, and by his want of Reſt, and Fever that attended them, a continual Cough, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he was brought ſo low, and ſo much waſted, as if he would in a ſhort time dye of a Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                     <p>A Young Man, living near <hi>Cripple-Gate,</hi> that was ſtrong, and every way ſound in his Entrails, as he was doing ſomething at his Trade of Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, by which he got a convenient Livelyhood, by chance with laughing heartily let three Nails, which he held in his Mouth for his uſe, go down through his Wind-pipe into his Lungs. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon being ſeized with a moſt violent Cough and continual tickling, he fell into a very great ſpitting of Blood. From which Symptoms, I know not by what means, he got himſelf free. But this is moſt certain, that though thoſe Nails never came up again, either of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, or with the help of Art, yet the Young Man was very well for the ſpace of ſeveral Months, following his Employment as before. Neither did he (as he told me) find himſelf any thing worſe, but only from that time he uſed to be troubled with a dry and hesking Cough, and likewiſe with ſome Oppreſſion. He was ſo well, that he thought himſelf fit for a Wife, and he did Marry one. But upon his Wedding-day, whether from his more liberal drinking of Wine, or from his dancing too much (with which the Nails, that before lay unmov'd, and as it were buried in the ſubſtance of the Lungs, were ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red again) the poor Bridegroom in the Evening was taken with dreadful Spaſms, and a moſt Acute pain in his Breaſt and Side, and withal a difficulty of Breathing, and a dry, but very troubleſome Cough, ſo that he could ſcarcely lye in his Bed, or get the leaſt ſleep. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he began to be very Feveriſh, though his extream Parts ſeemed to be cold from the violence
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:59580:128"/>
of the Spaſmodick pain. When they had tryed all the Old Women's, and Apothecary's little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts in vain, and without any benefit, at length I being very earneſtly entreated, went about the third day of his illneſs to ſee him. I preſently apprehended the Diſtemper to be plainly Perip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neumonick, and therefore I ordered plentiful Bleeding, Fomentations, and Liniments exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, likewiſe <hi>Linctuſes,</hi> and Pectoral Apozemes, and temperate Juleps of Antiſpaſmodick Waters to be given inwardly. But theſe things doing no good, I ordered again and again ſome more Blood to be taken from him. And indeed I was forced for many days continually to inſiſt upon the uſe of ſeveral internal and external Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies before the poor Patient found the leaſt eaſe of his pain: But at length when his pain was ſomewhat mitigated, yet I could hardly with my Skill promote any Expectoration of Phlegm; nor wholly remove the Fever, though it ſeemed changed from the Nature of an Acute and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripneumonick, into a lingring and Hectick Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. So that the Patient being now freed from the violence of the Symptoms, though he was always Feveriſh, yet he could ſleep, and eat his Food better than before: But yet he grew every day weaker, and at length from an Univerſal Colliquation, he dyed plainly of a Conſumption within the ſpace of a Month or five Weeks.</p>
                     <p>Indeed I wonder'd very much at the obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Pain, and the difficulty of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectoration; and therefore, being directed by <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s Aphoriſm, I did fore-tell that a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption from an <hi>Empyema</hi> would follow. But I never did ſo much as dream of the Original cauſe, to wit, the Nails, which were ſlipt down into his Lungs, before the Patient's Life was paſt

                     <note place="margin">The French Diſeaſe often brings on Atrophy.</note>'TIS certain every <hi>French</hi> Pox if it be Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical, accompanyed with a virulent <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norrhoea,</hi> or many and large Ulcers, is always apt to bring the Patient by degrees into a Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſtate by the continual ſubſtraction of the Nutritious Juice from the Habit of the Body, of which ſort of Conſumption I have before diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed in the Firſt Book.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">And likewiſe a Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lungs.</note>It is alſo as true, and I have often obſerved in my Practice, that a true Conſumption of the Lungs has had its Original meerly from the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the Blood and Humours cauſed by the <hi>French</hi> Pox.</p>
                  <p>And it is no wonder, when the whole Maſs of Humours is ſo manifeſtly altered, and brought into a colliquative ſtate by the Ferment of this Diſtemper (which is evident enough from the Malignant Swellings, <hi>Gonorrhoea's,</hi> and Ulcers, that commonly accompany this Diſeaſe) if theſe kind of Venereal Swellings and Ulcers happen ſometimes alſo in the ſpongy and ſoft Subſtance of the Lungs; whereupon a true Pulmonary Conſumption muſt neceſſarily follow. Indeed I have rather wondred that we ever meet with the <hi>French</hi> Diſeaſe, eſpecially if it has been of a long ſtanding, or ill cured, without an Ulcer in the Lungs, and a Conſumption proceeding from it. But to ſpeak the truth, I very ſeldom, if ever,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:59580:129"/>
obſerved a Conſumption of the Lungs from the <hi>French</hi> Pox,<note place="margin">Which is rare, unleſs the Lungs were obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted before, or from ill man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement.</note> unleſs it has been where the Lungs were obſtructed, and diſpoſed to a Conſumption before; or at leaſt where there has been a bad management, and ill-natur'd Medicines have been given by ſome Quacks; and the often ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Cold in a Sweating Courſe, or in a Salivation, has been joyn'd with the <hi>French</hi> Pox. This Conſumption (if it be treated in due time, and in a due manner) is as eaſily cured as any other.<note place="margin">This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is of an Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> For (as far as I have obſerved) it is of an Aſthmatick Nature, and is wont to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with tough Phlegm, and a difficulty of Breathing rather than a violent Cough; and therefore it is Chronical, and aſcends ſlowly and by degrees to its higheſt degree; from whence it comes to paſs, that I have ſometimes obſerved ſome of theſe kind of Patients to live ſeveral Years in a Sickly and Conſumptive ſtate. Which perhaps may be partly from the continual uſe of the Decoction of <hi>Sarſa,</hi> and other things of that Nature; by which the Malignant Venom of the Humour, though it is not perfectly era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated, is in ſome meaſure obtunded. For I do not doubt but the peculiar Nature of the <hi>French</hi> Pox is ſo Venomous, that unleſs the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of the Humour happened to be corrected by the uſe of <hi>Calomelanos,</hi> a Decoction of the Woods, and other Medicines prepared by Art or Nature, every Conſumption from a <hi>French</hi> Pox in its own proper Nature would be Acute.</p>
                  <p>From a frequent Experience I do affirm,<note place="margin">This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is not to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red without Antivenereal Medicines mixt with the Pectoral.</note> that all Pectoral and Pulmonary Medicines, that are meerly ſuch, without mixing Antivenereal Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines with them, will do nothing towards the perfect Cure of this Conſumption. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no better Method can be thought

of, than to endeavour the healing of the Ulcers of the Lungs, and the reſtoring of the <hi>Craſis</hi> of the Blood,<note place="margin">The best thing is a Salivation.</note> which has been deſtroyed by the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal Ferment, by a <hi>Mercurial</hi> Salivation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Patient has been weakned by a long protraction of the Diſtemper, and ſo is unable to bear ſuch a continual and profuſe Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                     <note place="margin">What is to be done if the Patient can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear that.</note>But if the Patient, by reaſon of the extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Habit of his Body, does not ſeem to have ſtrength enough for this Method of Cure, all the hope that remains muſt be from the uſe of a Reſtorative Milk Diet; and then from a ſtrict and long uſe of a Decoction of <hi>Sarſa,</hi> and of my Balſamick Pills, giving likewiſe Purges with a moderate Doſe of <hi>Calomelanos</hi> mixt with them.

                     <p>A Young Girle about Twelve Years old, was perſwaded by the Enticements of a Laſcivious and Wicked Dancing Maſter, that was infected with the <hi>French</hi> Pox, to let him lye with her: Whereupon ſhe likewiſe by Contagion was ſo pepper'd with the Venereal Venom, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding one or two Salivations, which had been raiſed by ſome Empericks, and other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Cure that had been tryed in the ſpace of four Years, after her <hi>Uvula</hi> was eaten away, and after other marks of the <hi>French</hi> Pox yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, ſhe fell into a Conſumption of her Lungs, with a Hectick Fever, an Emaciation of her whole Body, a continual Cough, and a very great ſhortneſs of Breath, by reaſon of the tough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Phlegm ſtuffing her Pipes.

                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">How this Conſump ion is cauſed.</note>I Have alſo obſerved in my Practice theſe kind of Conſumptions; which are not cauſed (as it is commonly thought) by the tranſlation of the Purulent Matter into the Lungs (which to me ſeems impoſſible;) but by the Pollution of the whole Maſs of Blood by the violent keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of the Excrementitious Juice, which uſed to be continually thrown out by theſe Ulcers. From whence it comes to paſs, that the Blood being in this manner foul'd, does make it its bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to caſt off this extraneous and excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious Ferment, and to lodge it in the ſoft ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Lungs as it circulates through them, which many times according the Nature of the Matter is diſpoſed to a ſpeedy Putrefaction. And hereupon that Conſumption of the Lungs, which I make it my buſineſs to treat of in this Chapter, though it be ſometimes of a middle Nature,<note place="margin">This Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption is A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute.</note> yet for the moſt part it is Acute; yea, many times according to the Nature and Diſpoſition of the Ulcer of the Lungs,<note place="margin">And most commonly Mortal.</note> which cauſes it, very Acute, and almoſt always Incurable and Mortal, becauſe
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:59580:131"/>
it depends upon an inexhauſtible ſtock of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lurking in the Habit of the Body.</p>
                  <p>In the Cure of this kind of Conſumption,<note place="margin">The Cure.</note> beſides the General Method before preſcribed, I ſhall add theſe few things particularly to be obſerved.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The former, and accuſtomed Ulcers muſt as far as it is poſſible be revived; whereby the Humour may be diverted from the Lungs, and be evacuated by the uſual and leſs dangerous vents, though it may ſeem troubleſome.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, But if this cannot be obtained (which indeed is very ſeldom done) then frequent Iſſues, yea, and Veſicatories, but eſpecially applyed near the place which Nature firſt aſſign'd for the ſeparation of this Humour, ought to ſupply this defect, by which we may make ſome compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation to oppreſſed Nature, and particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive the Matter from the Lungs.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In the beginning of this Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to wit, when the Glands of the Lungs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſwell (which we may gueſs at by the Cough, difficulty of Breathing, and Feveriſh Heat) we muſt uſe Bleeding, and alſo repeat it if it be neceſſary. By which the ſtagnation of the Blood, which ariſes from the firſt reception of the Matter into the Lungs, and ſo the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the part may be prevented, or at leaſt abated.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Amongſt the more general Pectoral Medicines already deſcribed, I would commend the uſe of a Milk Diet, of Aſſe's Milk, the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeate</hi> Mineral Waters (if they are drank in time) of a Pulmonary Decoction of <hi>Sarſa,</hi> for ordinary Drink, of the Gums, Balſams, and Wood-lice, but eſpecially my Balſamick Pills.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:59580:132"/>Fifthly, But we muſt always add to the Pecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Medicines alſo thoſe things which have a reſpect to the peculiar Nature of the Ulcer, or Original Diſtemper.</p>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Simons,</hi> the Famous Surgeon before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, had (as he told me himſelf) a Fiſtula in his Fundament continually weeping for the ſpace of Twenty Years, which he did induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly preſerve inſtead of an Iſſue, whilſt he cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red very many in other Perſons, becauſe it did ſeem neither very troubleſome to him, nor at all dangerous. But by chance this accuſtomed Ulcer at length drying up of its own accord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Sixtieth Year of his Age, he preſently began to be affected with an Oppreſſion at the Breaſt, and a dry and troubleſome Cough. Which Symptoms for ſeveral Months he never minded, till being rouz'd from this ſtupid Neglect by a manifeſt falling away in his Fleſh, as well as a Hectick Fever; alſo by a frequent want of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, Sickneſs, Weakneſs, and other Signs of a preſent and confirm'd Conſumption, he deſired my Advice, but too late, when the poor Man had for ſome Weeks, and that in the Spring too, laboured under a great Colliquation, both by a Looſeneſs and Sweats, brought upon him by a Putrid Intermitting Fever, and was confin'd to his Bed in a weak condition. I did endeavour at leaſt to alleviate the Fever by the uſe of the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Bark; to abate his Looſeneſs with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringents and Opiates, to remove the cauſe of the Conſumption with the White Drink, a Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monary Decoction of <hi>Sarſa,</hi> and Lime-water, with all other ſorts of Pectoral and Specifick

                     <p>Of a Conſumption proceeding from the Green-Sickneſs, and a Suppreſſion of the Monthly Purgations in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THIS is moſt commonly the Original of Women's Conſumptions,<note place="margin">Ab Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Menſes is commonly the Original of Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> and I have very ſeldom ſeen any Woman that was capable of the Monthly Purgations, either Virgin, married Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or Widdow, who ever fell into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption without an Obſtruction of theſe Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations coming upon it, either in the beginning, or at leaſt in the progreſs of the Diſtemper.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Sometimes 'tis the effect of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</note>'Tis true indeed this Obſtruction may ariſe in the progreſs of a Conſumption from the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſht ſtate of the Blood, by reaſon of the want of new Nutritious Juice; and therefore is to be accounted an Effect rather than the Cauſe of this Diſeaſe.<note place="margin">But many times the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of it.</note> But many times it is the occaſion of a Conſumption, and that not only in Virgins and Widdows, but even in married Women. For when there is an Obſtruction of theſe Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations cauſed by Paſſions of the Mind, taking of Cold, or uſing ſuch Food as breeds a bad Juice, the Maſs of Blood is apt to be foul'd, and to be rendred cachectick by thoſe Excrements, which uſed to be thrown out, but are now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it: By which Maſs of Humours now gathered in the Blood the Lungs are wont to be ſtufft, and thereupon a Cough, difficulty of
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:59580:133"/>
Breathing, and the other ordinary Symptoms of a Conſumption are wont to ariſe: From which being a long time neglected, a Conſumption of a peculiar Nature, attended with prickings, and dreadful pains in the Sides does many times ariſe.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of this Diſtemper, Bleeding,<note place="margin">What is to be done in the beginning of this Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</note> and moderate Purging with the <hi>Sacred Tincture,</hi> and other things of that Nature; and the uſe of <hi>Chalybeate Medicines,</hi> but eſpecially my <hi>Chalybeate Electuary,</hi> which I may afterwards mention in the Chapter of a <hi>Chloroſis, &amp;c.</hi> are convenient to provoke the <hi>Menſes,</hi> and to correct the Cache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical ſtate of the Blood: But if through the neglect of the timely uſe of theſe things, the Patient is already brought into a Conſumptive ſtate, it is not only in vain to try any of theſe things (becauſe we cannot expect thoſe Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in this impoveriſht ſtate of the Blood) but alſo very prejudicial to the Patient to give them. For it is to no purpoſe to diminiſh the ſtock of Blood by opening a Vein; and with the uſe of <hi>Chalybeates</hi> it is more exagitated and grows hot. Therefore in this caſe the Patient muſt be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the General Method of Cure uſed in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the Lungs, and already deſcribed; and the Pains of the Sides muſt be eaſed with warm Liniments and Fomentations, mentioned in another place. But the Conſumption being once cured, and the Body grown luſty again, the Uterine Veſſels being repleniſh'd with Blood and Nutritious Juice, are wont to be opened of their own accord in a thin Country Air. But we muſt relieve this defect of Nature (if ſhe is ſtill deficient after the Patient is recovered) with the help of Art? For if the Obſtruction ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, the Patient will quickly grow Cachectical
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:59580:134"/>
again, from whence we may juſtly expect a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the Conſumption. Therefore in this caſe let the Patient be kept in a thin Air, and ſhake off all Sadneſs and troubleſome Cares; let her uſe Exerciſe, and due Frictions; as alſo bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Antiſcorbutick, and <hi>Chalybeate</hi> Medicines, but eſpecially the Vitriolick Mineral Waters, if it be a proper time of the Year for them. This Conſumption, becauſe it proceeds from a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chexy, is for the moſt part Chronical, and not preſently Mortal. But if it is not cured in the beginning, it is very difficult, if ever, to be cured; and indeed the Green-Sickneſs of Virgins has very often this Fatal Event; becauſe the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of a Conſumption and a Green-Sickneſs are ſo much alike, that the Common People ſeldom perceive when one comes to be joyned to the other, till the Conſumption is come almoſt to its Third and Fatal Degree. And from hence it is that I am wont always to ſuſpect a Chronical Cough that attends a <hi>Chloroſis.</hi>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of a Conſumption cauſed by a Perip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neumony, and a Pleuriſy.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IT is well enough known to all thoſe that have but a little Skill in Phyſick,<note place="margin">A Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion often proceeds from a Peripneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and Pleuriſy.</note> that a Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is wont to ariſe likewiſe from theſe Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers very often. And this happens ſometimes from the Ignorance or Neglect of the Phyſician, ſometimes from the perverſeneſs and peculiar Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Original Diſtemper, or a previous diſpoſition in the Patient to a Conſumption: Many times too the Patient himſelf, and his Friends that are about him, are to be blamed, who not obſerving the proper Directions of the Phyſician, in Bleeding ſo often as is neceſſary, in the ſeaſonable and plentiful adminiſtration and taking of Pectoral Medicines, and in the other parts of a due management, do many times lay the Foundation of a Conſumption, that follows afterwards. For a Conſumption follows after a Peripneumony and a Pleuriſy, for the Reaſons following.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The firſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why it does ſo.</note> When the Blood is left in a Colliqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſtate by theſe Diſtempers, which is wont to happen likewiſe for two cauſes; to wit, Firſt, when the Patient has been Habitually prediſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to a Conſumption by a propagation from the Parents, or by a long abuſe of the ſix non-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turals; in which caſe the Blood and Lungs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heated and inflamed, are very difficultly brought to a due temper; for the Peripneumony
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:59580:136"/>
and Pleuriſy being once conquered, the putrid heat of the Blood degenerates into a Hectical, or Habitual heat, ſo that afterwards the Chyle can neither be perfectly united, nor amicably mixt with the Maſs of Blood: And from this Colliquative ſtate of the Blood a Conſumption of the Lungs muſt neceſſarily follow. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and it may be this more frequently happens from the perverſeneſs of the Patient, and the timorouſneſs of his Friends, and thoſe that are about him; and perhaps too from the Ignorance, or at leaſt the Negligence of the Phyſician, when timely and plentiful Bleedings, which are not only neceſſary to relieve the Pain, but alſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely requiſite from the degree and exigence of the Fever, and the Inflammatory diſpoſition of the Blood, are wholly omitted. For in this caſe there ſtill remains a Hectick Heat in the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of the Patient, which diſpoſes him to a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Conſumption, after a due Concoction and Expectoration of the Matter, which was gathered in the Lungs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The ſecond Reaſon want of due Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectoration.</note>Secondly, When the Matter that is gathered in the Lungs is not at all concocted and expecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, or not in a ſufficient quantity, or at leaſt not ſo ſoon as it ought to be. And this is wont to come to paſs from ſeveral cauſes: As firſt, when the parts of the Lungs, that are inflamed, are the Veſicles, or Air-Glands, and thereupon the Matter, that is lodged in them, though it be concocted as it ſhould be, yet being contained in its proper <hi>Cyſtiſes,</hi> does not find a paſſage out, notwithſtanding the moſt diligent uſe of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorating Medicines. For though there is a greater quantity of purulent Matter concocted and gathered in the Glandules with the uſe of thoſe things, and thereupon there follows an
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:59580:136"/>
Apoſteme of a great bigneſs;<note place="margin">Which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſteme.</note> yet becauſe the Matter does not find an immediate Vent, no Expectoration ſucceeds, and ſo the Lungs are not able to clear themſelves; whereby it comes to paſs, that after the Apoſteme is broke, there remains a foul Ulcer in the Lungs, proportionate to the largeneſs of the Apoſteme. And upon this breaking of the Apoſteme, the Matter that is contained in it,<note place="margin">Which when it breakt, empties itſelf either out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,</note> is wont to empty it ſelf ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther outwardly or inwardly, according to the Situation of the ſuppurated part. For if the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Glandules are placed near the branches of the Wind-pipe, when the <hi>Cyſtis</hi> is broke, the Matter eaſily finds a vent into the Wind-pipe: And many times the Patient is ſuddenly ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, or ready to be choaked with the violent guſhing out of the Matter,<note place="margin">And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</note> flowing out all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this way: Which I ſometime ſince found in Mr. <hi>White</hi>'s Son, whoſe caſe I ſhall give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of in the end of this Chapter. But if theſe Glandules are placed at that diſtance,<note place="margin">Or inwardly.</note> that the Matter cannot find a paſſage into the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Wind-pipe it ſelf, thoſe parts do in progreſs of time ſwell to a great bigneſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon at length, when the <hi>Cyſtis</hi> breaks, the Matter diffuſing it ſelf every where through the whole ſubſtance of the Lungs, does perfectly deſtroy their Tone. Yea, ſometimes I have obſerved the Lungs to be ſo much diſtended with it, that part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from their diſtention, and partly from the Acrimony of the Matter, that has inſinuated it ſelf into them (the outward Membrane, which inveſts the Lungs being once broken, or eroded) the matter has fallen continually, and plentifully out of the Lungs into the Cavity of the Breaſt: And thereupon in the dead Body, when it has been opened, though we found an Ulcer only in
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:59580:137"/>
the upper part of the Lungs, and the Tone of the Lungs every where corrupted with the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paſſing through them, yet we met with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Pints of purulent Matter, which was faln into the Cavity of the Breaſt through the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Membrane, after the manner of an <hi>Empyema.</hi> And from hence it came to paſs, that when the Phyſician had done all he could in preſcribing, and the Patient had been as diligent in the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Expectorating Medicines, yet we did no good with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Expecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by very profuſe and unſeaſonable Bleedings.</note>Secondly, When with unſeaſonable, and very profuſe Bleedings the Blood is grown ſo cold, that the ſuppuration of the inflamed part is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hindred, or at leaſt comes to be late. For every one, that underſtands any thing of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery or Phyſick, knows that Bleeding cauſes a ſuppuration to be ſlower than otherwiſe it would be. And that famous Aphoriſm of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> is no leſs true, <hi>That unleſs thoſe that have a Pleuriſy do expectorate in fourteen days, if they live ſo long, they will be Empyical upon the fortieth day;</hi> ſo great a quantity of true Matter being in that ſpace of time collected in the Lungs, that by reaſon of the quantity, and Acrimony of it, it is apt to make its way through the broken and eroded Membrane of the Lungs into the very Cavity of the Breaſt.<note place="margin">From the want of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoral Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.</note> Thirdly, this alſo ſometimes happens through the careleſneſs of the Phyſician, or elſe the perverſeneſs of the Patient, from the neglect of the uſe of Expectorating Medicines in the beginning of a Pleuriſy and Peripneumony. Fourthly, in fine, this often happens to Infants for want of Underſtanding, becauſe they have not wit enough to raiſe and ſpit out the Puru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Phlegm which is lodged in their Lungs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="267" facs="tcp:59580:137"/>This Conſumption is always very Acute,<note place="margin">This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is always A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it proceeds from an Acute Diſtemper pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding, by which not only the Patient has been very much weakned, but likewiſe the Maſs of Blood has been left in a Colliquative ſtate; yea, and very often there has happened to be a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Matter made in the Lungs. So that this Conſumption has ſcarcely gone by the Name of a Conſumption, before the Patient has arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved plainly to the ſtate of a <hi>Maraſmus.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Cure of this Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, when 'tis from a Colliquative ſtate of the Blood.</note> If this Conſumption has had its beginning from a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquative, and too hot a ſtate of the Blood, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the preceding Diſtempers, we muſt not only continue the uſe of Expectorating, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Antiphthiſical Medicines, (which yet muſt be of thoſe, that are more mild, and not very hot) but we ought alſo to preſcribe Temperate Pearl Juleps to be taken plentifully to temper the heat of the Blood; as alſo Milk-water, Snail-water, yea, and the <hi>Chalybeate</hi> Waters, if it be a time of the Year proper for the uſe of them; but above all we muſt have recourſe to Bleeding (however the Patient is weakned, and his Body brought into a Tabid ſtate by his former Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per) and that not once only, but frequently; and we muſt repeat it too (if it be neceſſary) not with too ſparing a Hand.</p>
                  <p>But if this Conſumption proceeds from the breaking of the Glandulous Apoſteme emptying it ſelf by the Wind-pipe,<note place="margin">The Cure, when 'tis from the breaking of an Apoſteme.</note> we muſt promote the Purgation of the Lungs by this High-way with the plentiful uſe of Expectorating Medicines. And if there is any fear that the Patient will be choak'd after the firſt breaking of the Abſceſs with the Matter ruſhing too faſt, and in too great a quantity into the branches of the Wind-pipe, (which I remember happened to Mr. <hi>White</hi>'s
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:59580:138"/>
Son, and to ſome others) we muſt haſten the Expectoration by giving Oxymel of Squills, and other gentle Vomits; and then provoking them to Vomit by tickling the Tonſils and <hi>Uvula</hi> with a Feather dipt in Oyl. Whereby it comes to paſs, that a violent motion of the Stomack being excited in Vomiting, the Lungs alſo being agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by it, can more eaſily free themſelves from that glutinous Matter which ſticks in them. The greateſt part of the collected Matter being in this manner once evacuated, that which remains muſt be alſo brought away with the diligent uſe of Expectorating Medicines. Which being done, the Cure in progreſs of time may by degrees be perfected with a Milk Diet, Temperate Juleps, the Balſamick Medicines before deſcribed, and with the <hi>Chalybeate</hi> Waters drank in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in a wholſom Air.<note place="margin">When a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racenteſis is to be made.</note> But if by the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Hectick heat, a redneſs in the Cheeks coming every day, a difficulty of Breathing, without any conſiderable Cough attending them; but eſpecially by a fulneſs and weight in one or both the Hypochondres, and a fluctuation of Matter in the Breaſt, perceived by its moving from one ſide to another, this Conſumption ſeems to have been occaſioned by ſome Matter, that has been gathered in the Glandulous Apoſtems of the Lungs, running through their outward Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, when it is eroded, or broken, into the Cavity of the Breaſt, after the manner of an <hi>Empyema;</hi> then I ſay the Matter that fluctuates in the Breaſt, and is continually dropping out of the Lungs, muſt be conveniently taken out at due intervals as the Patient can bear it, by a <hi>Paracenteſis</hi> made in a convenient place near that Hypochondre where the greateſt weight is felt. The reſt of the Cure is to be performed with
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:59580:138"/>
the plentiful uſe of Wood-lice, Balſamick Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, and of Temperate Juleps; as likewiſe with a Milk Diet, Decoctions of <hi>Sarſa, Chaly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beate</hi> Remedies, but eſpecially the <hi>Chalybeate</hi> Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                  <p>But if by reaſon of the weakneſs of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,<note place="margin">When there is Matter in the Breast, and a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centeſis will not be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we muſt uſe Diure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</note> or the timorouſneſs of them that are about him, we may not be allowed to make a <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centeſis,</hi> we muſt endeavour to evacuate the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by a long and plentiful uſe of Diuretick Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, as Wood-lice, Salt of Amber, my Diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick and Lubricating Apozeme, which I ſhall give an Account of preſently in the next Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is ſometimes done with good, though more uncertain Succeſs (as I found in Mr. <hi>White</hi>'s Son, whoſe Caſe I ſhall think it worth my while preſently to ſubjoyn.<note place="margin">How the Cure muſt be compleated.</note>) Afterwards the Cure muſt be compleated with a Milk Diet, the uſe of Balſamick and <hi>Chalybeate</hi> Remedies, and likewiſe with Decoctions of <hi>Sarſa</hi> impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with Pectoral and Vulnerary Herbs, that are very temperate.</p>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>White,</hi> who lived in the Burrough of <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark,</hi> his younger Son <hi>Samuel,</hi> about the Seventh Year of his Age, and in the Year 1670. fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a true Pleuriſy, with an Inflammatory Fever, a continual, but dry Cough, and a dreadful pain in his Side. After they had firſt tryed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things for three days without any benefit, at length I was called, and ordered about ſix Ounces of Blood to be taken immediately from his left Arm, becauſe his pain was chiefly in that Side, and the Parts to be externally anointed with an Anodyne Liniment, and likewiſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectorating Medicines to be given inwardly in a good quantity in the form of a <hi>Linctus</hi> and <hi>Apozeme.</hi> They had a great deal of difficulty to make the Boy take internal Medicines. But the Pain, and his Fever being ſufficient Reaſons for the doing of it, I bled him once every day for five days ſucceſſively, with the Advice and Conſent of my Famous Colleague Dr. <hi>Mickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwait.</hi> And for the farther mitigating of the pain I ordered an Anodyne Fomentation in two Oxe's Bladders to be alternately applyed, with a Liniment, and Bliſtering Plaiſters to be put upon the Neck, and the inſide of the Arms. But however neither the Pain, nor the Fever ſeem'd to abate, till at length about the Ninth day of the Diſeaſe, Nature of her own accord went to work, and relieved her ſelf by a bleeding at the Noſe; and in this manner at the ſame hour of the day for three days one after another, did Nature, as if ſhe were led by ſome Benignity, continually perform the Office of a Surgeon, and that with very good Succeſs; for as the Pain,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:59580:139"/>
ſo likewiſe the Fever went almoſt quite off. But an Expectoration could not be procured by any Art through the whole courſe of the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore being moved by the Authority of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> I declared my Opinion openly in the preſence of his Friends, that an <hi>Empyema</hi> would follow afterwards within Forty days. And as I ſaid, ſo it came to paſs: For the poor emaciated Boy lay with a redneſs in his Cheeks, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned every day, a moderate Hectick Fever, a continual dry Cough, and ſhortneſs of Breath, gradually waſting every day until the fortieth day of the Diſeaſe; the greateſt part of the time likewiſe being drawn in on the left Side, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained much of a gravative pain under the ſhort Ribs of that Side.</p>
                     <p>On the fortieth day I went to ſee him in the Morning, and found him eating of a little Fiſh or two, and more chearful than ordinary. But for all that, remembring that Prognoſtick of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> concerning the fortieth day, I ordered an Emetick Mixture of Salt of Vitriol, and Oxy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel of Squills to be in readineſs, that it might be given him by Spoonfuls to make him Vomit, if upon the ſudden rupture of the Apoſteme he ſhould be in danger of being choak'd with the too quick paſſing of the Matter into the branches of the Wind-pipe. I had ſcarce been gone an hour but the Patient wak'd out of his ſleep al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſtrangled; and in that manner he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued for the ſpace of four hours before they could find me, without even any ſenſible Reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or Pulſe, with his Eyes ſet, and his Teeth and Hands Spaſmodically ſhut, cold, and e'en dead. At laſt I came, and ordered that the Mixture (which I had before taken care ſhould
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:59580:140"/>
be in a readineſs, though as yet by reaſon of the Fright they were in that were about him, who lookt upon him to be dead, it was not yet gi-given) to be put down his Throat by Spoonfuls, his Mouth being opened by force, and his Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils to be tickled with a Feather dipt in Oyl; with which being in a ſhort time provoked to Vomit, he brought up not only crude Chyle out of his Stomack, but alſo near a Pint of <hi>Pus</hi> plainly fetid out of his Lungs; and thereupon with the uſe of a Cordial Julep both his Spaſms and his Strangulation went off, the heat of the Extream Parts too, and his Pulſe came again, and at length after three hours he began to mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome incoherent words; and after ſome quiet ſleeps he came to himſelf: And ſo within 24 hours he was hungry, and asked for ſomething to eat, to the great Amazement of his Friends, and thoſe that were about him. But neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he was not only weak, and confined to his Bed, but alſo emaciated, and Hectical, and lay continually Coughing, and fetching his Breath very ſhort from the weight of that Matter in the Cavity of his Breaſt, which preſt upon his Diaphragm, as if he would in a ſhort time dye of a Conſumption. By reaſon of the Acute Conſumption which was upon him, and his Weakneſs, I dare not try to evacuate the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by Catharticks, nor to let it out by a <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centeſis;</hi> becauſe as they that were about him were againſt it, ſo indeed there appeared no protuberance in the Hypochondres, to ſhew the right place where the aperture ſhould be made. And therefore for the preſent I reſolved to bring the buſineſs about by a long and ſlow Method, by ordering a Milk Diet to temper his Blood, and the frequent uſe of the following <hi>Apozeme,</hi>
                        <pb n="273" facs="tcp:59580:140"/>
partly Pectoral, and partly Diuretick, with which (if it were poſſible) I might bring away the Matter by the Urinary paſſages without any loſs of his ſtrength: The form of the <hi>Apozeme</hi> was this which follows.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take the Seeds of Mallows, of Marſh-mallows, of each three Drams, the four greater cold Seeds, of each a Dram, of red Cicers an Ounce, of Winter-Cherries two Drams, the Leaves of Colts-foot, Maiden-hair, of each a handful, ſeven Figgs, fifteen Sebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens, Liquorice ſliced an Ounce, boyl them in two Quarts of Spring-water to a Quart. To the Liquor when it is ſtrained add of Syrup of Marſh-mallows an Ounce. Mingle them, and make an Apozeme.</hi> With this Management (and the addition of a Pearl Julep, and a Pectoral <hi>Linctus</hi>) his ſtrength ſeemed to be much mended. But upon that there aroſe an Univerſal Dropſie, which increaſed ſo much, that the poor Patient ſeemed every day ready to dye for want of Breath. But with the plentiful uſe of Salt of Amber, gentle Purges, and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeate</hi> Electuaries (Balſamick and Pectoral Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines being always mixt with them) he grew perfectly well of his Conſumption and Dropſie both, with the help of the Spring, and Country Air, and is yet living, in health, ſtrong, and luſty, following his Buſineſs of Merchandize.</p>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Gifford</hi>'s Daughter in <hi>Fleet-Lane,</hi> about the Eighth Year of her Age was taken with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory Fever, a Pain in her Side, and a troubleſome and dry Cough. I being called af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Second or Third day of the Diſeaſe, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Diagnoſtick Signs that the Patient had a Pleuriſy, ordered a Vein to be opened once,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:59580:141"/>
and again, Liniments and Fomentations to be applyed externally; and likewiſe Expectorating Medicines to be given her plentifully (which ſhe took too ſparingly:) I ordered likewiſe Bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters as it was neceſſary upon the account of her Fever, and the Affection of her Nerves, and Pearl Juleps made of Cephalick and Cordial Waters. After the uſe of theſe things, the Inflammatory Fever turned to a Hectick, and the Convulſive Pain of her Side into a Gravative Pain, and thereupon all the Symptoms appeared more mild. But becauſe no Phlegm could by any Art be brought out of the Lungs by Coughing, I did much ſuſpect that the Putrid Phlegm which had been concocted in the Lungs, had found ſome other way through the very ſubſtance of them into the Cavity of the Breaſt, and that my poor Patient would at laſt dye of an Empyical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, cauſed by the Pleuriſy, for want of Expectoration. And indeed I was not much out in my Conjecture: For after the poor Girle had lain languiſhing for Twenty days after the end of the true Pleuriſy, every day pining away with a continual Hectick Fever, a redneſs in her Cheeks often returning, the palms of her Hands very dry, with a dry and troubleſome Cough, pertinacious Watchings, ſhortneſs of Breath, and other expenſive Symptoms; at laſt ſhe began to complain of a gravative pain of her Side about the left Hypochondre, which increaſed ſo one day after another, that at laſt ſhe could not be moved, nor ſet upright without crying out. But after the Thirtieth day of the Diſeaſe looking upon the Part affected, I found it ſwelled, and riſing a little with a point. But yet I ſtay'd till the fortieth day, and then Mr. <hi>Hollier,</hi> a very Skilful Surgeon, being called in, we took out by
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:59580:141"/>
degrees the putrid Phlegm by a <hi>Paracenteſis</hi> made a little above the Diaphragm in the ſpace of a Month: For by reaſon of the emaciated ſtate of her Body ſhe could not bear the taking away of much at a time. But for a Year or two the Wound was deſignedly kept open in the ſame part, like as an Iſſue. In the mean time making uſe of a Milk Diet, Balſamick Medicines, Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and drinking freely and a long time a Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerary Decoction of <hi>Sarſa,</hi> &amp;c. (with the help of the Country Air) interpoſing likewiſe at due intervals, and according to the ſtrength of the Patient, Purges made of <hi>Calomelanos</hi> and <hi>Diagry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi> at length ſhe recovered out of her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive ſtate, having got a good Colour, and Fleſh, and ſo ſhe continued for ſeveral Years without the leaſt Symptom of her former Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, but only that ſhe was ſomewhat drawn in with a crookedneſs on the Side that had been affected, to her dying day, when ſhe was taken off by a Malignant Fever.</p>

                     <note place="margin">There is a Colliquation in a Gout and Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſm.</note>IN a Gout and Rheumatiſm, eſpecially that which is true, and Humoroſe (which is cauſed by a ſharp Ferment ſupplyed from the Nerves) there is ſuch an evident Colliquation in the whole Maſs of Blood, that no Body can reaſonably think it ſtrange, that a Conſumption ſhould ariſe from theſe Diſtempers (but eſpecially when they are ſtubborn, and Chronical, and return often.) And hereupon it is an eaſie matter to obſerve, that a Rheumatick Pain,<note place="margin">In Rheuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Pains there is a Cough.</note> coming from the taking of Cold, ſeldom if ever is wont to ſeize upon the Joynts without a Pulmonary Cough. And as I have ſeen that great Man, the Lord <hi>Bridgman,</hi> Mr. <hi>Philips,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Tibs,</hi> and many others, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter frequent and long Fits of the Gout and Rheumatiſm, dye at laſt of a Conſumption or <hi>Aſthma;</hi> ſo I have likewiſe obſerved, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an Acute and Fatal Conſumption has fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed upon the firſt Fit of a Rheumatiſm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption it ſometimes Acute.</note>This Conſumption when it ſeizes them from the firſt Invaſion of a Rheumatiſm, happens ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be Acute, for this Reaſon; becauſe it proceeds from a Colliquation of the Humours in an Acute Fit of a Humoroſe Rheumatiſm. And therefore becauſe it partakes of the Nature of an ordinary Conſumption,<note place="margin">And muſt be treated with the general Method.</note> it ought to be treated wholly in the General Method; that is, with the uſe of Lubricating, Incraſſating, Opiate,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:59580:142"/>
and other Pectoral Medicines. And indeed it has been my Practice, and that with very good Succeſs, to preſcribe in every Rheumatick Fit the plentiful uſe of Pectoral, Lubricating, and Incraſſating <hi>Apozemes</hi> and <hi>Linctuſes,</hi> though there be no urgent Cough, nor difficulty of Breathing, not only to temper and ſoften the Blood, but likewiſe to prevent a Conſumption, which uſes often to be the effect of a Rheumatiſm.</p>
                  <p>But whenever this Conſumption proceeds from an old Gout, or a Rheumatiſm,<note place="margin">When it comes from an old Gout, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'tis Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical.</note> that has retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned frequently, it is plainly Chronical, and does gradually in ſeveral Years create trouble to the Lungs, and the Parts that ſerve for Reſpiration.

Becauſe it ſeems to ariſe rather from a Stupor of the Nerves, than from a Colliquation of the Humours.</p>
                  <p>But yet this Aſthmatical Conſumption to me ſeems to be of a peculiar Nature,<note place="margin">But of a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> becauſe it is not at all relieved by the choice of a good Air.

And from thence alſo it comes to paſs, that Lubricating, and Expectorating Medicines do no good in this caſe, though Incraſſating, and Opiate Medicines are fatally Miſchievous. But there is more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to be expected from the frequent and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful giving of Spirit of Hartſhorn, of Salt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack, and Chymical Oyl of Juniper, and other things of that Nature, that excite the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and comfort the Nerves, than from any Opiates, or Pectoral Medicines.</p>

profuſely, and the often repeating of it in the Fits of a Rheumatiſm; the <hi>Craſis</hi> of the Blood being thereby deſtroy'd, and the whole Maſs of it impoveriſht, as it uſes to happen in all immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Haemorrhages.</p>
                  <p>I have likewiſe very often by Experience found the extraordinary Vertue of the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Bark in extinguiſhing the Colliquative Hectick Flame, which has been kindled in the Blood,<note place="margin">The <hi>Peruvian</hi> Bark does well.</note> and is left there by its Rheumatick ſtate, which Flame, unleſs it is taken away either by ſome Art, or by Nature, does moſt certainly prepare the way to this Pulmonary Conſumption.</p>
                  <p>I have obſerved likewiſe that <hi>Chalybeate</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines do for the ſame Reaſon conduce very much in the beginning of this Diſtemper,<note place="margin">So <hi>Chalybe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi> Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.</note> at leaſt to the gaining of ſome reſpite, if not to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Cure; but eſpecially the <hi>Chalybeate</hi> Waters, if it be not too late when they are drank, if they paſs plentifully enough by Urine.</p>

                     <p>Mrs. <hi>Laurence,</hi> about the Five and Thirtieth Year of her Age, at which time too ſhe was big with Child, fell into an Univerſal Rheumatiſm, and committed her ſelf to the care of a certain Apothecary for ſeveral Months; till at length with a Cough, difficulty of Breathing, Hectick Fever, Emaciation, and other Symptoms of this kind, which ſhe then had upon her, it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain whether ſhe would dye of a Rheuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, or of a Conſumption; the Rheumatiſm (which before was a genuine one) being dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated into a Nervous Rheumatiſm, attended with a rigidity, and a wandring pain in the Limbs, but with no Swelling.

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:59580:148"/>
therefore on the Ninth of <hi>June</hi> I ordered four or five Spoonfuls of the following Julep to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her when ſhe was faint.</p>

                     <p>I repeated the Bag of Antiſcorbutick Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, and ordered the Purging Pills to be taken every fourth Night.</p>
                     <p>The Nerves having been relieved three or four times with the uſe of the Julep, that had been preſcribed, I obſerved beſides her continual Hectick Heat, ſometimes alſo a Fit of a true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting Fever, ſeizing her firſt with a chilneſs, and going off with profuſe Sweats, though 'twas by uncertain intervals. And thereupon I did not without reaſon ſuſpect that her loſs of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, her continual Hectick Fever, and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Weakneſs, did proceed from this Feveriſh Ferment lurking within, which had never yet been thrown out of the Maſs of Blood; and which hitherto had ſo like a <hi>Proteus</hi> in various ſhapes deceived my ſight. And therefore now I go, and encounter this Enemy with all the Power of the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Bark: For I promiſed my ſelf (and my hopes were not fruſtrated, as the Event did afterwards prove) that when this Enemy was vanquiſht, the ſtate of her Health would be very much reſtored upon it; however Baths, Fomentations, and other things of that kind would be of great uſe to extirpate fully the Trophies of the Gout, which were left in her knotted and weakned Joynts. And therefore,</p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>June</hi> 13. I ordered the following Draught to be given, and to be repeated every four hours, for ſeven or eight times.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take Baum-water, Black-Cherry-water, of each an Ounce, Epidemick-water, Syrup of Clove-Gilly-flowers, of each two Drams, of the</hi> Peruvian <hi>Bark finely pouder'd a Dram;</hi> mix them, and make a Draught. I ordered likewiſe the following Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lep to be taken by ſpoonfuls when ſhe was faint.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take of Carduus-water ſix Ounces, Barley-Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon-water four Ounces, ſtrong Piony-water two Ounces, prepared Pearl a Dram and half, white Sugar five Drams.</hi> Mix them, and make a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lep.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>June</hi> 15. <hi>Take of the</hi> Peruvian <hi>Bark finely pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd five Drams, the Mucilage of Gum Tragacanth a ſufficient quantity:</hi> Make them up into Pills of a middle ſize to be gilt, of which let her take ſix at four a Clock in the Afternoon, and when ſhe goes to Reſt from day to day, taking every Morning the <hi>Chalybeate</hi> Syrup before ordered. Let the Bag of Antiſcorbutick Ingredients be likewiſe renewed. But though the Patient was perfectly freed from the Fever Fits, yet ſtill her ſickneſs at her Stomack, and want of Appetite continued, together with her Weakneſs, and the other Trophies of her inveterate Enemy. And therefore though I changed the form of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, yet I ſtill purſued the Enemy, that was now plainly upon its flight, with the Bark, in the manner following.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take of the Ingredients of the Purging bitter De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction a ſufficient quantity, Salt of Wormwood half a Dram, the</hi> Peruvian <hi>Bark pouder'd half an Ounce: Infuſe them in a due manner, and boyl them in a ſufficient quantity of Spring-water to twelve Ounces.</hi>

Let her take four Ounces of the Liquor preſt out hard from the Ingredients, every Morning, and repeat it for three days together, continuing the uſe of the <hi>Chalybeate</hi> Syrup at Four a Clock in the Afternoon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>June</hi> 27. I ordered the following Bolus to be taken every ſix hours, with four Ounces of the following Apozem, for three days together.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take of the</hi> Peruvian <hi>Bark finely pouder'd half a Dram, Syrup of Mugwort a ſufficient quantity;</hi> mix them, and make a Bolus. <hi>Take of the</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruvian <hi>Bark pouder'd half an Ounce, infuſe and boyl it in Carduus-water and White-Wine, of each a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient quantity, to twelve Ounces.</hi> Strain it out for uſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>July</hi> 6. Becauſe the Nervous Parts ſeemed ſtill to be ſomewhat affected, I ordered her three of the following Pills to be taken three times a day at Phyſical hours, and to drink four Ounces of the Tincture of the Bark juſt before pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take of the Pouder of the</hi> Peruvian <hi>Bark two Drams, Troches of Myrrh a Dram, Caſtor,</hi> Ens Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neris, <hi>of each two Scruples, the Mucilage of Gum Tragacanth a ſufficient quantity.</hi> Mix them, and make them into Pills of a middle ſize, to be guilt.</p>
                     <p>With this plentiful uſe of the Bark, though it was given in ſeveral forms, my Patient was in a wonderful manner recover'd to a ſtate of Health, ſo as to be every way well, and was perfectly freed from all the Symptoms of her Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Rheumatiſm; but only that the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons and Joynts, eſpecially thoſe of her Hands, continued ſtiff, and likewiſe ſomething ſwell'd, and ſhe did not yet gather Fleſh enough. And therefore when I had by way of Preparation
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:59580:149"/>
taken care to Purge her with fifteen Grains of <hi>Extractum Rudii,</hi> and a Scruple of the Fetid Pill, I ſent her down to the Bath to uſe thoſe Waters, both outwardly by bathing, and inwardly by drinking them for ſix Weeks, ordering the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, and Joynts that were ſwell'd at the end of every bathing, to be embrocated for a good while and freely with the Waters of the King's Bath, and the ſame Parts (when ſhe was laid in her Bed, and diſpoſed to ſweat) to be a good while anointed with the following Liniment. <hi>Take Oyntment of Marſh-mallows, Nerve Oyntment, of each an Ounce, Oyl of Scorpions, of white Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, of each half an Ounce, of Chymical Oyl of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeds three Drams:</hi> Mix them, and make a Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And for fear ſhe ſhould be faint in the uſe of the Bath, ſhe had the following Cordial in readineſs, to be taken by ſpoonfuls at any time when ſhe pleaſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take the Epidemick-Water, Dr.</hi> Stephens<hi>'s Water, of each half a Pint, of Syrup of Clove-Gillyflowers two Ounces.</hi> Mix them, and make a Cordial Julep.</p>
                     <p>In the Month of <hi>September</hi> my Patient returned from the uſe of the <hi>Bath,</hi> having found a great deal of Benefit: But eſpecially her Tendons and Joynts, that were affected, were very much reſtored by it; to promote the Cure of which yet farther, I adviſed her to uſe one of our Bagnio's here at <hi>London</hi> twice or thrice a Week, together with the following Medicines.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sept.</hi> 4. 1683. <hi>Take of the beſt Sarſaparilla four Ounces, China-Roots an Ounce and half, ſhavings of Ivory, of Hartſhorn, of each three Drams, of Raiſins of the Sun ſtoned two Ounces, Liquorice ſliced half an Ounce, after a due Infuſion boyl them in four quarts of Spring-water to two quarts.</hi> Let her take half
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:59580:150"/>
a Pint of the Liquor ſtrained thrice a day at Phyſical hours.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take Ceruſs of Antimony, Wood-lice prepared, of each a Dram and half.</hi> Mix them together for ſix Papers, of which let her take one three times a day with every Draught of the Decoction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preſcribed, but eſpecially when ſhe goes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Bagnio.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as ſhe had made an end of uſing the Bagnio, I endeavoured to promote a gentle <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoreſis</hi> every Night with the uſe of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Draught.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sept.</hi> 12. 1683. <hi>Take Carduus-water, diſtilled Treacle-water, of each an Ounce, of Ceruſs of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony a Scruple, Syrup of Violets two Drams.</hi> Mix them, and make a Draught, to be repeated for Ten Nights together. With the uſe of which her Joynts and Tendons received a great deal of benefit. But at length for fear the Patient's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe into an Intermitting Fever at the end of the Year (of which I had a great and reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Suſpicion) ſhould fruſtrate the perfecting of her Cure, I adviſed her to repeat the uſe of the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Bark for ſeveral days, to be taken every fourth or fifth hour, in the form of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Apozem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sept.</hi> 20. 1683. <hi>Take of the</hi> Peruvian <hi>Bark pouder'd an Ounce, boyl it in Carduus-water and White-wine, of each an equal quantity to a pint and half, and then let it be preſt out very hard.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, For the getting of her Fleſh again, and the farther tempering of her Hectick heat, I adviſed her to go into a ſtrict Milk Diet, to be uſed for ſix Weeks in the Country Air. With the uſe of which ſhe grew plump, and recovered her perfect Health, her Monthly Purgations then at length returning with a florid colour, which
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:59580:150"/>
before this had been quite ſtopt for four Years, by reaſon of the emaciated and thin Habit of her Body.</p>
                     <p>But the next Year, which was 1684 in the Month of <hi>June,</hi> becauſe of ſome ſtiffneſs, which remained in the Tendons of her Wriſts, and of one Foot, ſhe went again to the <hi>Bath,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards repeated the Milk Diet. From which time to this preſent ſhe has enjoyed perfect Health; and likewiſe having been married, has had Children.</p>
                     <p>With almoſt the ſame Method I happily cured Mr. <hi>Overton,</hi> living without <hi>Newgate,</hi> beyond the Expectation of all his Friends; who with a long Rheumatiſm was at length brought plainly into a Tabid ſtate, with a difficulty of Breathing, a violent and perpetual Cough, a continual He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick Fever, a ſpitting of Matter like <hi>Pus,</hi> and the other ſigns of a Fatal Conſumption of the Lungs.

                     <p>Mrs. <hi>Lane,</hi> a Barber's Wife, whoſe Husband lived in <hi>Cow-Lane,</hi> being about Five and Thirty Years old, when ſhe had lived in a Conſumptive ſtate, Emaciated, and Coughing, for ſeveral Years paſt, fell in the Month of <hi>April,</hi> 1684. into a true Rheumatiſm, with violent Pains, and inflam'd Swellings, which yet were moving ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly from one Joynt to another; with a Fever likewiſe, that was evidently of a remitting kind, accompanying of it; which had the Type of a <hi>Tertian</hi> (which I have very often obſerved to be the Nature eſpecially peculiar to a Rheuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Fever.) In which caſe, whenever a new
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:59580:151"/>
Fever-Fit ſeizes the Patient, the Rheumatick Pain and Swelling, which before were almoſt quieted, are wont to be renewed in the Parts that were before affected, or elſe by a <hi>Metaſtaſis</hi> of the Matter (as the Ancients love to ſpeak) to be tranſlated to ſome other Joynts. But the Fits were very long, laſting for the ſpace of Twelve or Sixteen hours, and attended with a want of ſleep, light-headedneſs, great tumbling and toſſing, heat, and a very Feveriſh Pulſe. All which Symptoms uſed to be followed, and go off with great Sweats. But at the beginning of every Fit I obſerved that her Rheumatick Pains always grew more ſharp in the Joynts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, or elſe ſeized ſome other Joynts that were free before. So that a new Rheumatiſm ſeemed to come with every Fever-Fit. Being called in the time of her Fit, I endeavoured to ſatisfie the preſent Indications with <hi>Bleeding, Bliſters, an Anodyne Draught, Tincture of Roſes, a Pectoral Linctus, and a Pearl Julep.</hi> And indeed all the Symptoms going off at the end of the Fit, when I came to ſee my Patient the next day, I reckon'd the Diſtemper was overcome, and removed with thoſe things I had ordered, till at length by the return of the Fever, and Rheumatick Fit the next Night, I plainly underſtood how vainly I had hitherto flattered my ſelf. And therefore according to the urgency of the Symptoms that indicated it, I bled her again, ordering the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of the <hi>Hypnotick</hi> Draught, and likewiſe the application of an Anodyne Cataplaſm to the Joynts, that were affected with extream pain from the Rheumatiſm. But after I found the Type of the Fever and Rheumatiſm for two or three times, to be plainly a <hi>Tertian;</hi> and that notwithſtanding the Method I had before pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,

all things continually grew worſe, the very Syſtem of the Nerves being now at length ſeized with Spaſms, but eſpecially in the time of the Fit; and her Mouth being likewiſe ulcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a Thruſh, being led by a happy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, I betook my ſelf in this deplorable caſe to the uſe of the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Bark; preſcribing a Dram to be given every third or fourth hour, when her Fit was off. With the uſe of which in the ſpace of Twenty Four hours, ſhe was freed both from her Rheumatiſm and Fever, without any other Remedy, and was well after her manner, that is, Conſumptively; but yet ſhe was leſs oppreſt in her Lungs, than ſhe had been before ſhe fell ſick. But as ſoon as ſhe got rid of her Pain and Fever, ſhe wholly neglected her Chronical Conſumption (which likewiſe ſeemed to be helpt with the Bleedings, the uſe of the Bark, and the other Medicines before preſcribed) refuſing all ſorts of Medicines; and thereupon after a Year or two ſhe dyed of that Chronical Conſumption of the Lungs.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of a Conſumption proceeding from Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, eſpecially ſuch as are from Surfeits, Scarlate, and Intermitting Fevers; as alſo from the Small-Pox and Meaſles.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">A Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion often proceeds from theſe Acute Diſeaſes.</note>I Have very often ſeen a Conſumption of the Lungs take its Original from theſe Acute Diſeaſes. Neither indeed have we any reaſon to think it ſtrange that a heat kindled in the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours by a Putrid Fever is wont to degenerate ſo eaſily into a Hectick, or Habitual heat ſeated in the Spirits, and ſolid Parts of the Body. For when the Spirits and Humours in the Habit of the Body have been a long time fed, or nouriſht by the Blood too much inflamed and heated, they do not eaſily ſhake off that Preternatural Heat. And what wonder is it if from this Hectical and fixt Flame a Colliquation and Conſumption are apt to follow?<note place="margin">Eſpecially from the Small-Pox, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> And this is wont to happen eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Small-Pox, Meaſles, and in Scarlate, and Crapulous Fevers. Becauſe in theſe Diſeaſes there is ſo great a Colliquation of the Humours follows, cauſed by that ſharp heat that attends them, that it can hardly be ſtopt afterwards; whereupon the new Chyle afterwards cannot be united, or aſſimilated to the Solid Parts. And from hence it comes to paſs, that the Preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Heat of the Parts is not always quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſht by the critical eruption made in the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:59580:152"/>
former Diſeaſes, but there ſtill remains a Hectick heat in the Solid Parts, together with a dry Cough, with other ſigns of the Serous, and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquative ſtate of the Blood (after the other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers are cured) which even preſages a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption that is to follow.</p>
                  <p>The moſt uſual fore-runner of this Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a light Peripneumonick Affection,<note place="margin">What is the uſual fore-runner of this Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</note> or Scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phulous Tubercles bred in the Lungs themſelves; which are always wont to ariſe firſt in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſion of the former Diſeaſes. From whence it comes to paſs, that not only a Feveriſh Heat is kindled again, but it likewiſe returns attended with a Cough, difficulty of Breathing, want of Reſt, a Thirſt, want of Appetite; yea, and ſometimes with a pain in the Breaſt, and other ſigns of an incipient Conſumption.<note place="margin">This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption for the moſt part is Acute.</note> For this Conſumption for the moſt part is quick, and Acute, becauſe it comes upon Nature when ſhe is already weakned by the former Diſtemper; neither can it be prevented,<note place="margin">Bleeding is neceſſary as well to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent as to Cure it.</note> or cured any way without timely and repeated Bleedings, though the ſtate of the Patient ſeems never ſo weak. And indeed the neglect of Bleeding, or doing of it too late, or too ſparingly in the declenſion of the preceding or Original Diſeaſe, uſes for the moſt part to be the occaſion of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
                  <p>But when we have bled the Patient as often,<note place="margin">After which Expectora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamick Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines must be uſed.</note> and as much as we ought to do, the reſt of the Cure is to be performed with the diligent uſe of Expectorating, and Balſamick Medicines, already deſcribed in the General Method; as alſo of a Milk Diet, and Temperate Juleps. What I have ſaid of a Conſumption coming after the Meaſles, Small-Pox, as alſo Scarlate, and Crapulous Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, (all which Diſeaſes are of one and the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:59580:153"/>
ſame kind, to wit, of a Seroſe, and Colliquative Nature) the ſame may likewiſe be affirmed with the ſame Reaſon of all Scorbutical and Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Fevers; as alſo, generally ſpeaking, of any kind of Fevers, that have terminated without a fair and due <hi>Criſis.</hi> For the Feveriſh Ferment being in this manner rather depreſt by force, than overcome, there ſucceeds a mild Hectical Heat to the former Putrid Flame, which will afterwards introduce a Conſumption after it. And therefore even in the declenſion of theſe Fevers,<note place="margin">In the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſion of ſome Fevers we muſt bleed.</note> what ſort ſoever they are of, we ought to bleed, and then finiſh the reſt of the Cure in the manner as I have hinted in this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Malignant Fevers may bring a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</note>And I do not doubt but that even Malignant and Peſtilential Fevers, which are wont to have a Critical termination by Apoſtemes and Ulcers, may likewiſe bring a Conſumption by throwing the Feveriſh Matter by the way of a <hi>Criſis</hi> upon the tender Subſtance of the Lungs, from whence Swellings, and ill-natur'd Ulcers ariſing, are apt to bring a very Acute Conſumption. But the Cure of it muſt be performed with the timely and diligent uſe of Expectorating, Abſterging, and Balſamick Medicines before deſcribed; by which means we may as ſoon as is poſſible clear the Lungs.<note place="margin">Obſervations concerning a Conſumption from Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</note> But here I have a mind to add ſome few things particularly of the Original of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption proceeding from Intermitting Fevers. <hi>Scil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſerv. </seg>1</label> Firſt, That I have obſerved a Conſumption to have its Original from no other Fever more frequently than from an Intermitting one. Which to me ſeems to happen for two Reaſons. Firſt, becauſe this Fever either from its own peculiar Nature (becauſe it has an inexhauſted Source in
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:59580:153"/>
the Habit of the Body) or from the neglect of giving Efficacious Medicines in time, and in a good quantity, is very Chronical, and many times though it is driven away, returns again; and from thence it comes to paſs that at length a Hectical, and continual heat is brought upon the Spirits and Solid Parts by this Putrid Heat prevailing for a long time; and thereupon there muſt neceſſarily follow a Serous Colliquation of the Humours, together with a Cough, and the other Symptoms that accompany a Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe this ſort of Patients, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no ſuſpicion that this kind of Diſtemper will be Mortal, as they commonly make ſlight of it, ſo they are wont to neglect themſelves, not only endeavouring to Cure themſelves with I know not what Receipts of Old Women, (from whence it comes to paſs, that under the pretence of Curing the Fever, they many times procure an Inflammatory and Venomous diſpoſition to the Blood and Humours) but likewiſe very often expoſing themſelves careleſly to the cold Air, even in the time of the Fit, and getting one Cold after another, they at length ſuffer for their careleſneſs and ignorance, by a Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cauſed by the often taking of Cold, and the neglecting of it too in this diſtemper'd ſtate of the Humours. Which Conſumption is wont to go by the leſs infamous Name of a Catarrh with theſe poor Patients; till at length through their Negligence it becomes incurable. And therefore I would give this Advice to all Perſons, that they do not from a falſe Opinion of the Innocent Nature of this Diſeaſe, truſt to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts of Quacks, and Old Women; but that they would immediately make it their buſineſs
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:59580:154"/>
to Cure it perfectly, and in due time, with the plentiful uſe of the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Bark (the only mighty Antidote of this Diſtemper) and to prevent the return of the Fever by repeating the uſe of it. For a frequent relapſe into this kind of Fever does threaten a Conſumption as well as if it were plainly continual. I likewiſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe theſe Patients out of the ſame good will to have a great care of taking of Cold ſo long as the Diſtemper continues, but eſpecially in the time of the Fit.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſerv. </seg>3</label> Thirdly, The Pathognomonick Sign of this Conſumption is, that from the firſt beginning of the Diſeaſe there is a Feveriſh Paroxyſm every day, or each day, or every third day, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the peculiar Nature of the Original Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, always joyned with the Hectick Fever, together with a Cough, difficulty of Breathing, and the other ordinary ſigns of a Pulmonary Conſumption.</p>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> a Painter, living in St. <hi>Nicholas Lane</hi> near <hi>Lumbard-ſtreet,</hi> about the Year 1674. in the beginning of the Month of <hi>October,</hi> at Midnight, after the eating too freely of Salmon, and his Wife at the ſame hour were taken in their Beds with a <hi>Quotidian</hi> Ague, or as I think a Treble <hi>Quartane.</hi> The Wife was ill treated by an Apothecary with I know not what Medicines ſo long, that though ſhe ſeemed freed from the ſtated Fits of the Fever before <hi>January,</hi> yet by reaſon of her Weakneſs ſhe kept her Bed, and lay as if ſhe were juſt ready to dye. For her Pulſe was very weak, and quick, ſhe was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with frequent Swoonings, pertinacious Watchings, almoſt a continual Sickneſs, and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitings, had large and Colliquative Sweats, a great Thirſt, a plentiful Spitting, a continual Reſtleſneſs, and extraordinary Affections of her Nerves like Hyſterical, and no Stomack. The poor ſick Woman, that now expected to dye every moment, earneſtly wiſh'd for the return of her former Fever, ſo ſhe were upon that Condition freed from her preſent Miſeries. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given her the bitter Decoction with <hi>Senna</hi> twice for that purpoſe, as I would have it, I brought her former Fever again with its true Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riodick Fits. And then in the time between the Fits I ordered the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Bark in ſeveral forms to a good quantity, to wit, an Ounce and half. With the compleat uſe of which ſhe perfectly recovered without the leaſt return of her Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:59580:155"/>
or the Symptoms of it. Neither did I order her any thing more beſides Hyſterick Juleps and Opiates, as the Symptoms required.</p>
                     <p>But the Husband, becauſe he was of a ſtrong Habit of Body, and engaged in much Buſineſs, but eſpecially becauſe he obſerved his Wife to grow every day worſe with the Medicines which were unskilfully given her by the Apothecary, look'd out for no help for himſelf, either from a Phyſician or the Apothecary, expecting that the Spring being now approaching, his Diſtemper would go away of it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>And every day after his Fit was, off he did his Buſineſs both at home and abroad (his Fever in the mean time keeping its ſimple form with one and the ſame tenour in its ſtated Fits and Intermiſſions all this while.) But at length after his Wife was well, when he found himſelf every day to grow weaker and weaker with his Diſtemper, he was about to deſire my help; but both the approaching of the Spring-time, and a hurry of great Buſineſs diverted him from this Prudent Reſolution. 'Tis true indeed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Opinion he had before, about the beginning of the next Spring his Fever in its ſimple form left him of its own accord; but ſtill he had no Stomack, his Strength was gone, the Habit of his Body lean and pale, his Pulſe always quick and weak; he had a great Thirſt, a ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Breath, a dry Cough, that troubled him continually both Day and Night, with all the other Symptoms of an Incipient Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>At length he comes to me, both he and his Wife imploring my help, and much lamenting his delay. Preſently I well enough thought I had ſufficient reaſon to believe that this Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pient
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:59580:155"/>
Conſumption was the true Off-ſpring of his former <hi>Proteus</hi>-like Diſeaſe; and therefore I ordered almoſt nothing of common Antiphthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical or Pectoral Medicines, with the help of which I thought it almoſt impoſſible that the Patient, who was now almoſt brought into the ſtate of a <hi>Maraſmus,</hi> ſhould be reſtored to his former Health. But I concluded that the whole Cure was to be performed with the uſe of the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Bark, by which means the Fever being once perfectly conquered, I rightly judged that the other Symptoms would go away of their own accord, as the Event it ſelf did happily prove. And therefore I made it my buſineſs only to make the form of the Medicine as grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as I could, leſt I ſhould have the Fancy of the Patient to ſtrive with as well as his Diſeaſe. And therefore I ordered the Pouder of the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruvian</hi> Bark in the form of Tablets, in the manner following.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take of the Pouder of the</hi> Peruvian <hi>Bark an Ounce and half, Sugar-candy diſſolved in eight Ounces of Wormwood-water, thickned with the Mucilage of Gum Tragacanth.</hi> Mix them, and make them into Tablets, ſo that every one may weigh two Drams; let him eat one four times a day, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing four Ounces of the clear Pectoral Decoction after it.</p>
                     <p>When he had taken all the Tablets, preſently that Hectick Fever (which as it was the Genuine Off-ſpring of the Intermitting Fever, ſo it ſtill par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took of the Nature of its Parent) plainly went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, together with his Cough, difficulty of Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and the other Company of Fatal Symptoms of a Conſumption; but only that his Appetite was not yet perfectly reſtored, neither had he got his Fleſh, by reaſon of the ſhortneſs of the time.
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:59580:156"/>
And therefore, the time of the Year enclining me to it, I ſent him preſently into the Country Air; out of which after the ſpace of two or three Weeks, he returned ſtrong and plump, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got a good Colour, and a great Stomack, and enjoys very good Health to this very day.</p>

                     <p>A certain <hi>Norway</hi> Merchant, that lived at <hi>Newington</hi> on the other ſide of the <hi>Thames,</hi> that Year when Mr. <hi>Talbor</hi> was very Famous for the liberal uſe of the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Bark in the Cure of Intermitting Fevers; and likewiſe that ſame Month, wherein I had recovered the ſame Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant's Wife beyond the expectation of all thoſe that were about her of a Remitting Fever, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with very direful Symptoms with the uſe of the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Bark amongſt other Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; when he himſelf was taken with a true and benign <hi>Tertian</hi> Ague: Leaving his Friend, and his known and familiar ordinary Phyſician, he went with the Croud to Mr. <hi>Talbor,</hi> and having paid five Guinea's, he had an Ounce of the Bark for a great Secret; which when he had taken, he preſently was well recovered. But there being no care taken by that Emperick to prevent the return of the Fever, after two, or at moſt three Weeks, the Diſtemper at length returned, of which he was freed again and again, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the uſe of the Bark, but not without giving in hand the former extravagant Price every time it returned. The Gentleman being ſaving, choſe rather to paſs the remaining part of the Winter under the miſerable Symptoms of this Fever, than to be always draining his Pocket in this manner, hoping in the mean time that
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:59580:156"/>
his Diſtemper would at leaſt leave him the next Spring of its own accord. But with the long continued courſe of this Fever (which perhaps the frequent taking of Cold in the time of the Fit, and the Old Women's and Quacks Receipts, that were none of the wholſomeſt (all which he was wont to uſe very greedily, and without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction) did promote.) I ſay, with the long continuance of this Ague, there ſeemed at the beginning of the Spring to be kindled a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Hectick Heat in the intervals of the Fits of the Putrid Fever, attended with a great Cough, difficulty of Breathing, Colliquative Sweats, a continual Thirſt, Nauſeating, and other Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of this kind. Whereupon before the end of <hi>June,</hi> at which time he deſired my help, thinking he ſhould ſoon dye of a Conſumption; he was ſo weak, and emaciated, that he had perfectly a <hi>Hippocratical</hi> Face, and when I firſt ſaw him I ſhould plainly have thought him paſt Cure, if this Conſumption had proceeded from any other cauſe than an Intermitting Fever. But yet I did rightly judge a Conſumption ariſing in this manner, though to all outward appearance deplorable, to be curable, becauſe it was in my Power, at leaſt at this time of the Year, to give that great Antidote, the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Bark, in that manner as not only to take off the Intermitting Fever, but alſo to prevent the return of it. Whereupon I did not at all doubt but when the Fuel was once taken away, the Hectical Flame would ſoon be extinguiſht of its own accord, together with the whole Company of Pulmonary Symptoms depending thereon. Which Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of mine was very quickly proved to be true by the happy Event. For the Fits of the Intermitting Fever being once taken away by
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:59580:157"/>
giving an Ounce of the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Bark in the form of Pills, in the ſpace of four or five days, the Hectick Fever alſo vaniſht of its own accord; likewiſe the Cough, with the other Pulmonary Symptoms was much leſſened, and his Appetite much increaſed. But when the return of the Original Diſtemper was prevented by repeating the uſe of the ſame Bark, all the Symptoms of the Conſumption vaniſht within the ſpace of a Month, even without a Grain of Pectoral Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines. And my Patient (as far as I know) to this very day looks well, and is luſty.</p>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Lane,</hi> a Vintner at the Sign of the <hi>Queen's Head</hi> in <hi>Southwark,</hi> a Man that was truly robuſt, and tall, about the middle of his Age, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>Autumn,</hi> in the Year 1668. was ſeized with a violent <hi>Quartan</hi> Ague; he preſently committed himſelf to the care of a Skilful Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, who treated him with the uſual Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and in the old Method, to wit, with Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Vomiting, frequent Purging, Febrifuge Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leps, and tedious Deobſtruent and Altering A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pozems. But yet he grew every day worſe; at length his Ague was doubled, yea, trebled, ſo that he was no day free from his Fever; and about the end of <hi>December</hi> his Fits were ſo long, that almoſt preſently after one was off another came on: He was ſo weak too, that he could ſcarcely riſe out of his Bed; and his Stomack was ſo weak, that he hardly could eat ſo much as Water-gruel. He was continually, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly Thirſty, becauſe he never ſeemed to be free from his Original Fever, or the Hectick, which was come upon it; and therefore being
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:59580:157"/>
reſtleſs, he was continually toſſing himſelf up and down in his Bed. And moreover there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared Purple Scorbutical Spots, and thoſe very large, every where almoſt all over his Body, but eſpecially in his Breaſt and Limbs: His Legs and Thighs, as alſo his Belly and Breaſt, were very much ſwelled, like thoſe that have the Dropſie. His Cough was troubleſome, and continual, and his breathing difficult, and very unequal. So that the Patient at the firſt ſight ſeemed to me to have not only an Intermittent Fever, but alſo a continual Hectick, ariſing from the former; and upon that to have fallen into a Pulmonary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and an Univerſal Dropſie. When it was ſo, that they plainly had no hopes of the Patient's Life, I was at laſt ſent for by his Friends, not ſo much to Cure his Fever (which they judged to be incurable before the Spring Weather came) as to give him ſome help againſt his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, Dropſie, and Scurvy, Diſtempers that raged ſo violently, that they ſeemed to threaten almoſt immediate Death. But the Patient him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf loathing even Food it ſelf, though the moſt delicious, much more Medicines, with the great quantity of which his Stomack had been long burdened, did with a great deal of difficulty conſent that I ſhould attempt his Cure with any kind of Medicines. But at length his Friends with much entreaty obtained this of him, that he would for three or four days take my Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Pills made of the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Bark, only for a Tryal.</p>
                     <p>In which time having taken ſix Drams of the Pouder, he preſently eſcaped the next Fit. The next day, when I came to ſee my Patient, I found him plainly Triumphing over his Enemy, eating a potch'd Egg, and ready to ride out in
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:59580:158"/>
a Coach, which was now at the Door, in order to follow his neceſſary Occaſions. But which ſeemed much more wonderful to me, as all the Spots were diſappeared, ſo likewiſe that Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Swelling went away without even any ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Evacuation. Alſo his difficulty of Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Cough, with the other Symptoms of an incipient Conſumption, ſeemed to be very much abated, and they decreaſed every day, till at laſt the Patient had by little and little recovered his former ſtate of Health. 'Tis true indeed, this Fever after a Month returned in the form of a ſimple <hi>Quartan,</hi> and continued till he had had almoſt four Fits. But yet it went quite away without the uſe of any Remedies, or the former Symptoms following upon it; from which time the Patient enjoyed his Health very well, till at length after one Year, and ſome part of another, he dyed of a Bleeding at the Noſe.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Blood, as ſoon as it has here and there in its Circulation diſtributed the new Chylous Parts, and thoſe that are fit for Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becomes plainly ſharp, as if it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bued with a Ferment, from the Saline and Acrious Particles, which by the Law of Nature it ſtill contains in it ſelf (to the end that from thence the Bile, and other neceſſary Ferments of the Body may be ſupplyed, and every day renewed.) And therefore by the ſame Sagacity of Nature there is Proviſion made that after ſhe has in this manner done what is ſufficient for the neceſſary Ferments, the Acrious and ſuperfluous remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſhould as Excrements be forthwith thruſt and thrown out by the pores of the Skin, by the Kidneys, the Glandules of the great Guts, and the other Avenues, or Emunctories of the Body; leſt the Maſs of Blood it ſelf being burdened, and oppreſt with this kind of Particles, and thereupon brought into a diſtemper'd ſtate, ſhould not be able to perform its Natural Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
                  <p>From what I have now ſaid it is evident to Reaſon how many ways a Jaundies is wont to occaſion a Conſumption.<note place="margin">How a Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies cauſes a Conſumption.</note> For whether it be Accidental, as when it proceeds from an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Natural courſe of the Bile from the Gall-Bladder into the Cavity of the <hi>Duodenum,</hi>
                     <pb n="308" facs="tcp:59580:159"/>
cauſed by a Stone, or the glutinouſneſs of the parts of the Bile; or whether it be more Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, coming from a defective ſeparation of the Bilious parts in the Liver, cauſed by a Schirrous hardneſs or an Exulceration of that part, there are two things, which muſt neceſſarily be the Effects of it; to wit, a want of Bile in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines, and too great a congeſtion of it in the Blood. By the firſt of theſe, Nature for want of a due <hi>Menſtruum</hi> in the Volatilization of the Chyle is hindred from the convenient ſeparation of the Excrementious from the Chylous parts: From whence it comes to paſs, that the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Guts containing in them both parts, are voided of a white colour, together with a manifeſt faintneſs and weakneſs of the Patient, even from the very beginning of the Diſtemper. Becauſe by this continual Subſtraction of the new Chyle there is cauſed by degrees an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal <hi>Atrophy;</hi> which I have already hinted in the Appendix to the Firſt Book. But by the latter the Maſs of Blood itſelf is altered and diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, as being too much ſaturated with Bilious Particles, that are ſharp and pungent. Which diſcovers itſelf not only by an Univerſal Itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing excited in the Habit of the Body, but alſo by a yellow Tincture coming upon all the Skin, and by the very red and yellowiſh colour of the Urine. From this Collection of ſharp and bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Particles in the blood (at leaſt when it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be long, and Habitual) no Body muſt think it ſtrange if even the very Maſs of Blood is vitiated, and contracts a Hectical Heat; and any one may as eaſily obſerve how ſoon the Lungs, being from thence affected with a Hecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Heat, are apt to be ſtufft, to ſwell, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, and putrefie. So that the Jaundies, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

For as it is impoſſible but the Lungs muſt be much injured by the conſent they have with the Liver that lyes ſo near to them, and muſt likewiſe neceſſarily partake with it of the Spaſmodick Contraction in the manner of Hyſterical Suffocations; whereupon their tender Subſtance muſt needs be very much inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and changed from their Natural Tone by that frequent Conſtriction; to wit, in an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Jaundies: So likewiſe whenever it is Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual, the Hypochondriacal Melancholy, which is wont always to accompany the Gravative Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion cauſed by the Obſtruction of the Liver, does diſpoſe Perſons to a Conſumption of the Lungs it may be more than any other Paſſions of the Mind.<note place="margin">A Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom cauſed by an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note> 'Tis true indeed that I have very ſeldom met with a Conſumption of the Lungs proceeding from an Accidental Jaundies, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Diſeaſe has had its Original from the Obſtruction of the Bile-duct, or from an Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and Exulceration of the Liver it ſelf: For by reaſon of the violent Colick, or Spaſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dick

Pain, and the Acute Inflammatory Fever, which are wont for the moſt part to accompany this Jaundice, the Patient very ſeldom happens to live ſo long, that the Blood can undergo ſo great an alteration from the Bilious Particles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternaturally heaped up in it, as to be diſpoſed to form a Conſumption of ſo Chronical a Nature. But before it is poſſible for the Blood to undergo ſuch an alteration as is able to produce ſo great an Effect, either the Diſtemper is taken off from the Patient by Art, or the Patient is killed by the Diſtemper.<note place="margin">But no Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe comes more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently upon a Chronical Jaundies.</note> But there is no Diſeaſe does come more frequently than a Conſumption upon a Chronical and Habitual Jaundies, proceeding from a Schirrouſneſs, or too great a Compact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and hardneſs of the Subſtance of the Liver; which Conſumption for the moſt part is wont to terminate in a Fatal Dropſie. For as this is a Diſeaſe of ſeveral Years, becauſe it is attended with no very great Symptom; ſo the Bile which is thereupon preternaturally heaped up in the Blood, though it is not in ſo great a quantity as in an Accidental Jaundies, yet by its long ſtay in, and frequent cohobations with it (if I may ſpeak) it does more effectually alter the whole Maſs, and diſorder it; and it is no wonder if the tender Subſtance of the Lungs does at length get ſome fatal Miſchief from it. The Evident or Procatarctick Cauſes of this Conſumption,<note place="margin">The Proca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarctick cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of this Conſumption.</note> are, commonly frequent and long Debauches, and the more grievous Paſſions of the Mind ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding alternately one another. By the firſt, the Subſtance of the Liver, and perhaps the Lungs too happens almoſt always to be too much heated and ſtuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> with ſuperfluous Juice; and by the latter it happens to be ſpaſmodically girt, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt. By both together the Liver (and it may
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:59580:160"/>
be the Lungs too) is rendred too cloſe or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact in its ſubſtance, if it does not alſo become Schirrous, or inflam'd and ulcerated. And from hence there muſt neceſſarily follow too great a Collection of Bile in the Blood, and thereupon a Morbid alteration of it, an Oppreſſion of the Hypochondres, a Melancholy, with the other ſigns juſt now mentioned, which tend to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the Lungs. And hereupon I uſe to call this a Crapulous Conſumption. For it is well known even to any one that has had but a little Experience in the Practice of Phyſick, how from anxious Care, and other troubleſom Paſſions of the Mind, and much and accuſtomed drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alternately ſucceeding one another, ſome happen often to pay dear for their ill-ſpent Life, by an untimely and miſerable loſs of it cauſed by this kind of Conſumption; to which an <hi>Aſcites,</hi> and ſometimes an <hi>Anaſarca</hi> is wont to be joyned not long before they dye.</p>
                  <p>The Diagnoſtick Signs of this Conſumption are to be taken from three Heads; to wit,<note place="margin">The Diagno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Signs of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption are taken, <hi>1.</hi> From the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine.</note> from the Urine, the Skin, and the Hypochondres. Firſt, for the Urine, that is very little in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, very full of contents, and of a very red and yellowiſh colour like Mum. 'Tis true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Urine of all Perſons in a Conſumption, by reaſon of the Fever, is high colour'd, and but little in quantity, and likewiſe by reaſon of the preſent Colliquation full of Contents; and in this manner it is wont to appear in Putrid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting Fevers. But in an Hepatick, or Icte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritious Conſumption all thoſe appearances are always found in a much greater degree; and by how much the more the Subſtance of the Liver is obſtructed, and the greater the Collection of the Bile in the Blood thereupon is, by ſo much
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:59580:161"/>
the more intenſe they always are. For by the mixture of the Bile the Serous or Urinary part of the Blood, as it uſes to be imbued with a very deep red and yellowiſh Tincture, ſo it is apt to be coagulated, and to pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

I do confeſs indeed that the Skin of all Perſons that are in a Conſumption, growing thick from the contraction of the Parts, ſo far as the Emacia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has prevailed, loſes its wonted luſtre; but in this Conſumption, beſides the paleneſs, and that ſqualidneſs of the Countenance, there is a different and uncertain yellowneſs more manifeſt one day than another;<note place="margin">

                        <hi>3.</hi> From the Hypochondres</note> Thirdly, there is always the ſenſe of a gravative Oppreſſion in the Hypochondres joyn'd with a Melancholy proceeding from the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Liver, and the bulk of it being enlarged thereupon; which very often grows ſo hard, and is ſo much increaſed in its Magnitude, that from thence not only the right Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre happens to be much diſtended and elevated, but likewiſe a Swelling, as it were hard and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, may be perceived in it, even by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal touch.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="313" facs="tcp:59580:161"/>This Conſumption is always Chronical,<note place="margin">This Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical.</note> and of ſeveral Years, becauſe it proceeds from a ſlow and lingring cauſe. That which the Perſons in this Conſumption ſpit is likewiſe more viſcid and plentiful, as it uſes to be in every ſlow Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
                  <p>As this Conſumption begins with a want of Appetite, and a loathing of Food,<note place="margin">It ends in an Aſcites.</note> ſo it almoſt always ends in a ſlow and painful <hi>Aſcites;</hi> to wit, as ſoon as the Liver is grown ſo hard from the progreſs of the Diſeaſe, that the Lympha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Veſſels, which creep upon it, happen from their Conſtriction to be broken; to which alſo a frequent Bleeding at the Noſe, proceeding from the circulation being hindred in other parts by the ſame Obſtructions, uſes almoſt always to be joyned. And though this Conſumption may be curable, when a Skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Phyſician is ſent for in time by a Patient, that will be Obedient to Rules, yet there is no Conſumption more Fatal than this is, when once there comes a Dropſie upon it from the Rupture of the <hi>Lympheducts</hi> cauſed by the hardneſs of the Liver. Nor indeed can the miſerable Patient have ſo much as an eaſie Death, by reaſon of the dreadful and continual Pains, his ſhortneſs of Breath, and the other Symptoms, that are wont to accompany this lingring Dropſie.</p>
                  <p>The General Indications of Cure are only two; to wit, the reſtitution of the Lungs,<note place="margin">The Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Cure.</note> that are diſtempered, to a ſound ſtate; and the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of the cauſe, by which the Lungs happened to be ill affected. The firſt Indication we may ſatisfie with the uſe of Pulmonary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, already mentioned in the Second Book in the General Method. But we muſt anſwer the ſecond Indication with the help of <hi>Hepaticks,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:59580:162"/>
Diureticks, Chalybeates,</hi> and other ſuch-like Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, which by removing the Obſtructions of the Liver, may reſtore the due and free ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the bilious Particles from the Maſs of Blood, and promote the Excretion of the Bile into the Inteſtines by the Bile-duct; by which means the cauſe of the <hi>Atrophy,</hi> and likewiſe of this Symptomatical Conſumption of the Lungs may be perfectly removed. But in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the General Method of the Cure of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is to be altered by the mixing of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paticks with Pulmonary Medicines (that we may ſatifie both Indications) I had rather ſhew by ſome Examples, than by the deſcription of a new Method, leaſt I ſhould ſeem to ſpin out this Diſcourſe to too tedious a length. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will preſently give a Hiſtory or two rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting particularly to this buſineſs, only premiſing firſt this general Obſervation,<note place="margin">The Pectoral Medicines we uſe muſt be always Inciding, Abſterſive, and Carmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native.</note> which it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to have in our Eye through the whole Method of Cure in this Conſumption; and that is that for Pectoral Medicines we muſt always make choice of thoſe that are Inciding, Abſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and Carminative; plainly avoid Incraſſating things, and uſe Mucilaginous Medicines, mixed with other altering Medicines moderately; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directed thus to do, not only by the tough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Phlegm (which this kind of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive Patients with all that they can do can hardly expectorate or hawk up;) but alſo by the obſtructed ſtate of the Liver it ſelf; where indeed in this caſe the firſt Seeds of this Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption are lurking: And from thence it comes to paſs, that though this Conſumption, when it is but beginning, may ſometimes admit of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Cure only with the uſe of Inciding and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeate</hi> Medicines, which by removing the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:59580:162"/>
of the Liver, and conſequently by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the Procatartick cauſe of the Diſeaſe, do likewiſe ſufficiently provide for the Lungs, which have not yet received ſo much Miſchief, but it may go off, and vaniſh of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord after there is no more Fuel ſupplyed from a diſtempered Liver.<note place="margin">But this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is never cured with Pectoral Medicines alone. We muſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from Incraſſating Medicines.</note> Yet I never ſaw this kind of Conſumption cured by Pulmonary Medicines alone; but I have always obſerved that it has been very much, and quickly confirmed even to a fatal degree with the plentiful uſe of Incraſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Medicines, and of all thoſe things, which increaſe the Obſtructions of the Liver. And therefore as common Milk, and all things made of it, yea, and Aſſe's Milk it ſelf, much more a ſtrict Milk Diet, is not convenient in the Cure of this Conſumption. So likewiſe for the ſame Reaſon it is beſt to abſtain from all uſe of <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum</hi> and any ſort of <hi>Opiates,</hi> unleſs there is a great neceſſity to give them.<note place="margin">How the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern himſelf.</note> The Patient muſt carefully avoid Sadneſs, which does always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the conſtriction of the parts of the Liver. He muſt likewiſe live in a thin and open Air, and there uſe moderate Exerciſe every day, all which do very much help to remove the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of the Liver. But above all things the long uſe of bitter, and <hi>Chalybeate</hi> Medicines does promote this Cure; and eſpecially the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeate</hi> Waters, if the Obſtructions are not come to that height as to hinder the paſſing off of the Waters by Urine. But if it be ſo, we muſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly abſtain from the uſe of them, leſt the Diſtemper be quickly rendred incurable, by bringing a Dropſie ſooner than it would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have happened.</p>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Dell,</hi> about the Twentieth Year of his Age, when he had for ſeveral Years before been troubled with a difficulty of Breathing, an Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Cough, together with other ſigns of a Chronical Conſumption of the Lungs, and had been affected with ſomewhat a yellowiſh Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture in his Skin, and had his Urine of the ſame colour, with other ſigns of an obſtructed Liver, fell at length into an Inflammatory Fever, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed with dreadful pains of his Breaſt, a Thirſt, want of Reſt, and likewiſe a little Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Blood in what he ſpit, and other ſigns of the Inflammation of the Tubercles of the Lungs, and he deſired my help. Preſently by looking on his Urine, which was of a very red yellowiſh colour, and likewiſe full of Contents like Mum; as alſo from a light yellowneſs of his Skin (though I had never ſeen the Young Man before this, that I know of) I rightly gueſt that the Peripneumonick Fever came by ſome Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent upon the Patient, that was before in the ſtate of an Icteritious or Hepatick Conſumption. And therefore the firſt day, which was the 9th. of <hi>Nov.</hi> 1688. I ordered Ten Ounces of Blood to be preſently taken away from the right Arm, and four Ounces of the following <hi>Apozeme</hi> to be given with a Spoonful of a <hi>Linctus</hi> very often.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take Oyl of ſweet Almonds, Syrup of Hedge-Muſtard, of each two Ounces, of white Sugar-candy two Drams;</hi> mix them exactly, and make a <hi>Linctus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take of the Pectoral Decoction depurated a Quart, Ticture of Saffron, the Syrup of the five opening Roots, of each an Ounce and half;</hi> mingle them, and make an <hi>Apozeme.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="317" facs="tcp:59580:163"/>To eaſe the pain of his Breaſt and Side, I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the following Fomentation to be applyed hot to the Parts affected, when the Pain was great, being firſt put into an Oxe's Bladder, ſo that the Bladder ſhould be but half full.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take Parſley-Roots, Fennel-Roots, Linſeed, Fenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greek-ſeeds, of each two Ounces, the Flowers of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momile, of Melilote, of each two handfuls;</hi> boyl them in a ſufficient quantity of Spring-water for a Fomentation. I took care that when the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was removed, a Flannel ſhould be rub'd warm with the following Liniment, and put upon the Parts affected.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take of the Oyntment of Marſh-mallows half an Ounce, Oyl of white Lillies, Oyl of Bricks, of each three Drams;</hi> mix them, and make a Liniment. To comfort his Spirits I ordered the following Cordial <hi>Julep</hi> to be taken by Spoonfuls at any time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take Baum-water, Black-Cherry-water, of each three Ounces, of Epidemick-water two Ounces, of Syrup of Clove-gillyflowers ten Drams;</hi> mix them, and make a <hi>Julep.</hi>

                        <hi>Nov.</hi> 10. His Fever being yet very high, and his Pain very violent, I again ordered Eight Ounces of Blood to be taken from the ſame Arm, at which he had been bled before; and becauſe of his great Thirſt fifteen Grains of the fineſt Salt of Nitre, and half a Dram of white Sugar mixt together, to be diſſolved in every draught of Beer that he took; likewiſe a Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Milk and Sugar, with Camomile-flowers boyled in the Milk to be given, if he had not a Stool of his own accord; and (if the Pain required it) a Plaiſter of equal quantities of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelſus</hi> and <hi>De Minio</hi> Plaiſters to be ſpread upon Leather, and to be applyed to the Parts affected;
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:59580:164"/>
likewiſe when he was to go to Reſt (if his Pain were ſtill very great) fifteen Drops of <hi>Helmont</hi>'s Liquid <hi>Laudanum,</hi> to be given in a little Draught of the <hi>Julep,</hi> and an Ounce of Stone-Horſe dung to be infuſed cold in the Pectoral <hi>Apozeme.</hi> With the uſe of which things he ſeemed to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better, his Fever being now very much abated; but then having made a diligent inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his Urine, Skin, and Stools, I was more certain of the Obſtruction of his Liver. And therefore in the ſtead of the former <hi>Apozeme,</hi> I ordered that which follows with a <hi>Linctus,</hi> to be taken to the quantity of four Ounces every four hours.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take a ſufficient quantity of the Ingredients of the Pectoral Decoction, the Roots of Parſley, Fennel, Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cory, Graſs, of each two Ounces, the Roots of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick, the inner Bark of the Barberry-tree, of each an Ounce, the ſhavings of Harts-horn, of Ivory, of each half an Ounce, of Currans two Ounces, of Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron tyed up in a Cloth half a Dram; boyl them in a ſufficient quantity of Spring-water to a Quart, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding when they have done boyling half a Pint of the beſt White-wine: To the Liquor when it is ſtrained add of the Magiſterial Water of Earth-worms three Ounces, the Syrup of the five Opening Roots, the Trau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Decoction, of each two Ounces;</hi> mix them, and make an <hi>Apozem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I likewiſe ordered two Ounces and a half of <hi>Tinctura Sacra</hi> to be given when he went to Reſt, with which he had two Stools the next Morning with relief. And therefore <hi>Nov.</hi> 11th. I ordered the uſe of the <hi>Apozem</hi> to be continued, the Tincture to be repeated when he went to Reſt, and two Quarts of the Purging Mineral Waters boyled to three Pints, and turned with half a Pint of Milk, to be given to drink the next Morning;
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:59580:164"/>
and in the room of the former <hi>Julep</hi> I ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the following to be drank plentifully.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take Parſley-water, Fennel-water, of each four Ounces, the Magiſterial Water of Earth-worms, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of the five Opening Roots, of each two Ounces.</hi> Mix them, and make a <hi>Julep.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Nov.</hi> 13. With this Method all the Symptoms began to be abated, and he did not make ſuch a Jaundies Urine as he did before. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I ordered a continuation of the <hi>Apozeme, Linctus,</hi> and <hi>Julep,</hi> which were laſt preſcribed, and the repetition of the <hi>Tinctura Sacra</hi> when he went to Reſt; and likewiſe for the farther open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Obſtructions of the Liver, three of the following Pills to be given every four hours in a Spoonful of the <hi>Linctus,</hi> with a Draught of the <hi>Apozeme.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take the Pouder of Wood-lice prepared, Gooſe-dung, of each a Dram, of Saffron half a Scruple, of the Syrup of the five Opening Roots a ſufficient quantity.</hi> Mix them, and make them into Pills of a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſize, to be gilt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nov.</hi> 14. After I had taken this care for the relief of his obſtructed Liver with good Succeſs, I began, as the thing required, to take more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular care of his Lungs, which had ſuffered very much from the defect of this Entrail, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Chronical Cough, as alſo his difficulty of Breathing proceeding from the toughneſs of the Phlegm, with which the branches of the Wind-pipe were ſtufft, did continually put me in mind of this part of my buſineſs; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when both were now not a little increaſed by a Peripneumonick Affection he had ſo lately had. And therefore beſides the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the uſe of the Abſterſive <hi>Linctus,</hi> and the <hi>Apozeme</hi> made of Pectorals, Hepaticks, and
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:59580:165"/>
Diureticks, and likewiſe of the Julep, and the repeating of the <hi>Tinctura Sacra</hi> when he went to Reſt; I ordered three of the following Pills to be taken in a Spoonful of the <hi>Linctus</hi> three times a day with a Draught of the <hi>Apozeme.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take of Wood-lice prepared three Drams; of Gum Ammoniack depurated a Dram and half, Flowers of Benjamin a Dram, Extract of Saffron, Balſam of Peru, of each half a Scruple, of Balſam of Sulphur Terebinthinate a ſufficient quantity;</hi> mix them, and make them into Pills of a middle ſize, to be gilt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nov.</hi> 15. I ordered him to inſiſt upon the ſame things, and after Midnight to repeat the <hi>Tinctura Sacra,</hi> and the Purging Waters next Morning. In which manner he proceeded by my Order to the Nineteeth day, but only in the ſtead of the Tincture I ſubſtituted half a Dram of the Stomack-Pills with Gums, becauſe of the loathing of that Medicine, which he began now to have from the long uſe of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nov.</hi> 19. I ordered the repeating of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack-Pills, and the Purging Waters every third day for three times, and that he ſhould perſiſt in the uſe of the <hi>Linctus, Apozeme,</hi> and <hi>Balſamick Pills</hi> for eight days.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Decemb.</hi> 10. He came to me into my Study, ſtrong, freſh-colour'd, and luſty, and much more free from the unhealthful Symptoms of his Lungs and Liver, than he had been for many Years paſt. But that this Chronical Miſchief might be perfectly eradicated, I ordered a Pint of the <hi>Tinctura Sacra,</hi> that he might take ſix or ſeven Spoonfuls every fourth Night, and that he ſhould take during the uſe of that four Ounces of the Pectoral and Hepatick <hi>Apozeme</hi> before deſcribed, three times a day at Phyſical hours on the
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:59580:165"/>
intermediate days. Moreover I ſeriouſly advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to uſe a Diet-drink made of Antiſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butick, Hepatick, and Pectoral Ingredients ſteep'd in Beer, and <hi>Sadler</hi>'s <hi>Chalybeate</hi> Waters at <hi>Iſlington</hi> the Spring and Summer following.</p>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Maddox,</hi> a Man at leaſt Fifty Years old, Gouty, and Hypochondriacal; from long Cares, and troubleſome Paſſions of his Mind, and from the hard drinking of Spirituous Liquors, which he had uſed himſelf to, fell by degrees into a want of Appetite, a diſpoſition to Vomiting, a ſtuffing of his Lungs, together with a Cough; and likewiſe an Obſtruction of his Liver, and a Conſumption of his whole Body. But I being called on the third day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> in the Year 1688. found him labouring under a Coſtiveneſs of his Belly, and a Spaſmodick, and very dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pain of his Back and Side, for ſeveral days, not without the manifeſt ſigns of a Fever, and a Languor upon him, which now were come to that height, that they plainly deſpaired even of his very Life. At firſt I thought the pain aroſe from a Stone-Colick, and thereupon I ordered Ten Ounces of Blood to be taken from his Arm (being induced to do it not only by the preſent Fever, but likewiſe for fear of an Inflammation of the Inteſtines that might follow by reaſon of the violent pain) I ordered the Parts affected to be anoynted warm with the Oyntment of Marſh-mallows, Oyl of white Lillies, and Oyl of Bricks mixt together, and Pills of half a Dram of <hi>Extractum Rudii,</hi> and a Grain and half of <hi>London Laudanum,</hi> to be given him in his Bed, that he might get ſome ſleep; likewiſe a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate

Cordial Julep to be given him often to drink to comfort him. And I ordered that if there were occaſion a Stool ſhould be procured after eight hours with a Clyſter of Milk and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar with Camomile-flowers boyled in the Milk; but when the Purge had once done working, they were to give him Twenty Drops of Liquid <hi>Laudanum</hi> in a ſmall Draught of the Cordial at the time he ſhould go to Reſt. But theſe things having no effect either to give him any Stools, or the eaſing of his Pain, on the 6th. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> I preſcribed a Mucilaginous and Lubricating A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pozeme to be drank often, and for three Nights together half a Dram of the Stomack-Pills with Gums, and a Grain and a half of <hi>London Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum,</hi> and the next Mornings two Quarts of the Purging Mineral Waters.</p>

without any relief of his Pain, which was ſo violent, that it could hardly be quieted even with the uſe of <hi>Laudanum</hi> it ſelf, though by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees I went as high as Forty, Fifty, Sixty Drops, which yet I was forced to repeat every Night.</p>

And I did not make any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the pain was felt in the lower parts of the Belly, juſt by the Region of the Kidneys and Bladder, and a great way below the ſeat of the Liver, becauſe I had often obſerved this ſame thing before in thoſe that had the Jaundies, whom I had often heard complaining and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out by reaſon of the violent pain which they felt in the lower parts of the Belly, when in truth the cauſe was remote in the right Hypochondre. Which appearance it is no hard matter to Account for; to wit, that as the ſubſtance of the Liver, according to my Hypotheſis and Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, by reaſon of its preternatural cloſeneſs and denſity, is almoſt deprived of Senſe; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for the ſame reaſon it affords a very difficult paſſage to the Blood, <hi>Lympha,</hi> and other Juices, that paſſed through it; ſo that the Veſſels, which tend hither from the lower parts of the Belly, muſt neceſſarily be diſtended beyond their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Tone, and be rendred varicous; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſuffer a great deal, till at length with the uſe of Hepatick and Deobſtruent Medicines the
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:59580:167"/>
Subſtance of the Liver had recovered its looſe and Natural Tone. From this Hypotheſis for three weeks I ordered two Ounces and a half of <hi>Tinctura Sacra</hi> to be given every Night when he went to Reſt (to which being forced, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Thirty, Forty, and at length Fifty Drops of Liquid <hi>Laudanum</hi> to be always added by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the violence of the pain.) I likewiſe ordered the Purging Apozem, with the addition of an Ounce and half of Syrup of Buckthorn, to be repeated every fourth Morning, and four Ounces of the following Diuretick Apozem to be given every four hours on the days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take the Roots of Succory, Graſs, Parſley, Fennel, of each two Ounces, the Roots of Turmerick, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Bark of the Barbery-tree, of each an Ounce, ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings of Hartſhorn, of Ivory, of each half an Ounce, of Currans two Ounces, of Saffron tyed up in a Linnen Cloth, and often ſqueezed, half a Scruple, of Aniſeeds half a Dram; boyl them in a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Spring-water to a Quart, adding when they are almoſt boyled enough half a Pint of White-wine. Add to the Liquor, when 'tis ſtrained, of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſterial Water of Earth-worms three Ounces, the Juice of two Lemons, of the Syrup of the five open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Roots three Ounces.</hi> Mix them, and make an Apozem.</p>
                     <p>I adviſed him likewiſe to take an Ounce and half of the Steel Wine ſweetned with a little brown Sugar every Morning.</p>
                     <p>After Eight or Ten days were now paſt, as his Pain began to abate, ſo he likewiſe began to go to Stool more eaſily. And therefore firſt I left out the Syrup of Buckthorn from the Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Apozem. And at length, <hi>Aug.</hi> 30. in the room of the Purging Apozem I ſubſtituted ſix
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:59580:167"/>
Pints of the Purging Waters crude, with which he now went to Stool well enough, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I took care they ſhould be repeated every third Morning.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sept.</hi> 6. Becauſe of his Faintneſs, cauſed by his frequent Purging (from that time he began to have ſo many Stools) I ordered the omiſſion of the Purging Waters for the future, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the following Cordial Julep to be given often.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take of Dr.</hi> Stephens<hi>'s Water two Ounces, of the Epidemick-water an Ounce, of Black-Cherry-water four Ounces, of Syrup of Clove-gillyſlowers ten Drams.</hi> Mix them, and make a Julep.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sept.</hi> 12. When now at length my Patient be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan plainly to loath the <hi>Tinctura Sacra</hi> by reaſon of the long uſe of it, inſtead of that, and the <hi>Laudanum</hi> mixt with it, I ſubſtituted the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack-Pills with Gums, <hi>Cynogloſs</hi>-Pill, of each twelve Grains, to be made into three Pills, which I ordered to be repeated every Night. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I now perceived by the plenty, and leſs high colour of his Urine, that the Obſtructions of his Liver were in ſome meaſure opened, I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered four of the following Pills to be taken every Morning for the farther promoting of Urine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take of the Pouder of Wood-lice half a Dram, of Salt of Amber very well cleared from the Oyl fifteen Grains, of Syrup of Marſh-mallows a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity;</hi> mix them, and make them into Pills of a middle ſize, to be gilt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sept.</hi> 18. When by the Tincture of his Urine being brought almoſt to its Natural colour, I rightly conjectured that the Liver was in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner reſtored to its Natural Tone, I adviſed my Patient that he ſhould try to open the Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:59580:168"/>
that remained, and to precipitate the Reliques of the Morbifick Matter by Urine with the uſe of <hi>Sadler</hi>'s <hi>Chalybeate</hi> Waters at <hi>Iſlington.</hi> But when after the tryal of a day or two, I was well enough ſatisfied that the obſtructed parts were not yet opened ſo much as to give the Waters liberty to paſs freely by the Kidneys, becauſe the <hi>Serum</hi> of the Blood being held by the bilious Particles, and too much ſaturated with them, and as it were coagulated, by reaſon of the preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural viſcouſneſs contracted thereupon, could not yet be readily ſtrained through the Pores of the Glandules of the Kidneys, I altered my mind, and inſtead of the Waters, I preſcribed the following Julep to be drank often and plentifully, and two Drams of the following <hi>Chalybeate</hi> Electuary to be given every Morning, expecting from the former of them a more plentiful flux of Urine, and from the latter a farther opening of the Obſtructions; whilſt at the ſame time I perſiſted to make the Tone of his Stomack more firm, and his Body more ſoluble by repeating the <hi>Tinctura Sacra</hi> every third Night. Neither did the Event de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my Expectation. The Julep was this:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take Parſley water, Fennel-water, of each a Pint, the Magiſterial Water of Earth-worms, the Syrup of the five opening Roots, of each ſix Ounces.</hi> Mix them. The Electuary was this:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take of the filings of Steel prepared two Drams, Saffron, Mace, of each a Scruple, Conſerve of Hipps, of the Flowers of Succory, of each an Ounce and half, of Syrup of Citron-peel a ſufficient quantity.</hi> Mix them, and make an Electuary.</p>
                     <p>With the uſe of theſe things my Patient plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recovered, being freed not only from his Pains, and his diſpoſition to Vomit, but likewiſe from the ſtuffing of his Lungs, which he uſed to have,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:59580:168"/>
from his Cough and difficulty of Breathing; as alſo from the yellowiſh Tincture of his Skin, and from all the other ſigns both of the Obſtructions of his Liver, and the Diſtemper of his Lungs. For he got a very good Appetite again, with which he ſoon was freed from his Conſumptive as well as his Jaundies ſtate, and continues hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto well, and ſtrong. However when I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt him, that I might quite pluck up the Roots of this Chronical Miſchief, which had been a long time fixt, <hi>Sept.</hi> 24. 1688. I wrote him this laſt Bill for his uſe, which, being now almoſt well, he was not ſo conformable to, as he uſed to be to the former, becauſe perhaps he did not think it ſo neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take of Tinctura Sacra a Pint:</hi> Let him take ſix or ſeven Spoonfuls every third Night.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take of Extractum Ecphracticum without Aloes an Ounce and half;</hi> make it into Pills of a middle ſize, to be gilt, of which let him take three twice a day every day, <hi>ſc.</hi> in the Morning, and at four of the Clock in the Afternoon.</p>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Dent,</hi> living in <hi>White-croſs-ſtreet,</hi> uſed to deſire my Help and Advice for ſeveral Years, whenever he, or any of his Family were ſick; a Man truly Honeſt, but ſomewhat Melancholy, and thereupon given to drink hard at Nights, and that very late, ſitting long at it to exhilerate his oppreſſed mind. With which he fell into a groſs, and as it were a callous Habit of Body. But at length about the Fiftieth Year of his Age he uſed to complain by long and uncertain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals of a Vertiginous Affection of his Head: And after three or four of theſe Fits (one or
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:59580:169"/>
two of which came near to an Apoplexy) being adviſed, and earneſtly entreated by his moſt dear and obſervant Wife, at length he conſented to commit this buſineſs to my care; a Man that abhorred Phyſick as much as any one. But with the taking away of Blood from the Jugular Vein, and the application of a large Bliſtering Plaiſter to his Neck, and likewiſe the giving of him a gentle Vomit, and after that a Purge or two, together with Cephalick Juleps between whiles; being once freed from the preſent Symptoms, he plainly refuſed <hi>Chalybeates,</hi> and other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, that were proper to open the Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> with which we might take care of his Health for the future. From which neglect it happened that in the ſpace of a Year or two he had a relapſe again and again. But at length a certain Chymical Emperick, that could boaſt ſufficiently, having given him I know not what <hi>Chalybeate Arcanum,</hi> without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Evacuation, it happened ſo that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe was quickly tranſlated from his Brain to his Lungs and Diaphragm in the Nature of a dry <hi>Aſthma;</hi> ſo that he, who was wont to complain of a Giddineſs before, did now much more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his perpetual Strangulation or Choaking, which indeed was viſible enough in the Face of the Patient to the very Spectators, becauſe not only he had now plainly loſt the Natural freſh colour of his Face with his Skin growing thick; but likewiſe his Cheeks, and very Lips inſtead of their wonted Roſy hew were baſely ting'd with a naſty black and blew colour, looking ſomething pale, as if the Patient had hung in a Halter a good while: Alſo his Eyes, and almoſt all his Skin were lightly ting'd with a Jaundies colour, his Urine alſo looking yellow after the manner
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:59580:169"/>
of thoſe that have the Jaundies; and as it was very little in quantity, ſo likewiſe always very full of contents, or ſetlings. There was alſo almoſt a perpetual Cough, but yet not ſo very violent, becauſe it proceeded from a tough Phlegm. But his Stomack was quite gone, and he had alſo a great Thirſt, with other Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of a Hectick Fever. And in this miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and lamentable ſtate he continued almoſt for the ſpace of two Years, deſiring the Care and Aſſiſtance ſometimes of one, ſometimes of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Phyſician, but not long obſervant of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections and Advice of any, till at length about three Months before he dyed, when he was plainly worn away with a <hi>Maraſmus</hi> from an Univerſal Colliquation, made by a plentiful ſpitting of Putrid Phlegm, vaſt Sweats, a Looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and very troubleſome Dropſical Swellings of his Leggs and Belly, he again, though 'twas now too late, with Tears and Entreaties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himſelf to my care, and was extreamly troubled that being tired with Medicines in the beginning of his Diſtemper, he had ſo ſoon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn himſelf from my Care and Advice, when he had found a great deal of benefit from Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the repeated uſe of <hi>Riverius</hi>'s Mixture, and other gentle Emeticks, and Purges, of my Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamick Pills, of Inciding and Abſterging Linctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and Pectoral Apozems, change of Air, and other ſuch-like things, though he was not yet recovered to a perfect ſtate of Health; ſeeing that now by reaſon of his Tabid Diſpoſition, and Univerſal Colliquation, he was altogether unable to bear thoſe Evacuations, that were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Nevertheleſs ſo far as I was able, I gave my helping Hand to this miſerable Patient; and firſt, I endeavoured to leſſen the Dropſical Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:59580:170"/>
by Purging off the Humour with the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Cathartick <hi>Bolus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take the Conſerve of the Flowers of Succory, Pouder of Rhubarb, of each a Scruple, of Roſin of Jalap half a Scruple, Salt of Wormwood five Grains, Syrup of Succory with Rhubarb a ſufficient quantity.</hi> Mix them, and make a <hi>Bolus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He bore the working of the firſt <hi>Bolus</hi> very well; but yet by reaſon of my Patient's Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and his Fever, I was afraid to repeat that <hi>Bolus</hi> ſo often as the Dropſie required it. I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in vain endeavoured to promote a flux of Urine with a Diuretick Julep of Parſley-water, Fennel-water, the Magiſterial Water of Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms, the Syrup of the five Opening Roots, Salt of Amber, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> With the uſe of which the Fever ſeemed to be ſomething increaſed, which at length I took off, at leaſt for ſome time, with the uſe of the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Bark. But when I found his Appetite was not reſtored by it, I did not expect ſo much from that Medicine. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I endeavoured to open the Obſtructions of his Liver (in which I did rightly ſuſpect the Original miſchief of his Diſtemper to lye) with the plentiful uſe of my Hepatick, and Diure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Apozem before mentioned, and the moſt convenient <hi>Chalybeate</hi> Medicines; as alſo to take care of his Lungs with my Balſamick Pills, Linctuſes, and Pectoral Apozemes. With the uſe of which he ſeemed to breath better, and to be leſs Feveriſh, and alſo to have his Skin and Urine leſs ting'd with a yellow colour. But his Colliquation ſtill perſiſting, and his Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie increaſing upon him, and when we were in the midſt of the Winter too, I plainly deſpaired of his Recovery; and therefore I ſent him, as he himſelf deſired, into the Country, and an
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:59580:170"/>
open Air, that he might there at leaſt have an eaſie Death, ſo far as his Symptoms would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of it: Where in the ſpace of a Month or five Weeks, being waſted by that Univerſal Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquation, he went out by degrees like a Candle; complaining more than of any other Symptoms of this, to wit, a dreadful, and as it were a Spaſmodick Pain, reaching from the right Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondre through a great part of the Belly; which indeed I could neither remove nor miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, either with Liniments, or Anodyne Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, or any other way: Which kind of Symptom I have almoſt always found in other ſuch-like Patients; which thing it was a very eaſie matter to account for from the Body being opened after he was dead. For the <hi>Sternum</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken off, and the Breaſt opened, we firſt ſaw the Lungs, very much enlarged in their big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and now changed in their colour, from that which was Natural to a black, or cineritious colour, ſticking almoſt every where very firmly to the ſides of the Breaſt, and in all the Lobes full of Tubercles, in ſome places maturated, but in others crude. From whence it is evident enough, that this was a true Conſumption of the Lungs, though a Symptomatical one. Alſo the Liver it ſelf, as it appeared much larger than it ought to be, (by which means preſſing the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragm underneath, without doubt it did not a little promote that continual Suffocation with which the Patient was troubled, let him be in what Air he would) ſo likewiſe the ſubſtance of it appeared more hard and compact than uſual, and what it ſhould be, as if it had been plainly parboyl'd; and the branches alſo of the <hi>Vena Portae</hi> running from the <hi>Hypogaſtrium</hi> to the Liver, were every where diſtended beyond their
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:59580:171"/>
Natural Tone, and varicous. From all which it is as eaſie to deduce the cauſe of this Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Icteritious diſpoſition, which here firſt gave the occaſion of the Conſumption, and of that horrid Pain, which reached from the Hypochondre through the Belly; which I obſerved not only this Patient, but alſo Mr. <hi>Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox</hi> before mentioned, Mrs. <hi>James,</hi> Mr. <hi>Freeſtone</hi> in <hi>Bucklersbury,</hi> and almoſt all others that have been ill in this manner, to complain of with great cries ſo earneſtly and continually, as if they had been troubled with no other Symptom. But in ſome this pain rather occupies the Region of the Kidneys and Loyns, being like a Nephritick pain, or a Scorbutical pain of the Loyns, as it happened to Mr. <hi>Maddox,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Freeſtone:</hi> But in others it is ſeated in the fore-part of the Belly, and eſpecially the <hi>Hypogaſtrium,</hi> in the form of a true Colick; in which manner the Patient of whom we are now ſpeaking, was affected.</p>
                     <p>From this as it were kind of compactneſs and hardneſs of the Subſtance of the Liver ſo preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally ſwelled, and from the remarkable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rication of the branches of the <hi>Vena Portae</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing thereupon as the Aetiology of this Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Icteritious Diſpoſition, by which my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient was firſt diſpoſed to a Conſumption, does appear plain enough to Reaſon, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to Senſe too: So no leſs evident is the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of that horrid pain, which occupyed the parts of the Belly, and perhaps too of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable <hi>Aſcites,</hi> by which without doubt the fatal day of his Death was much haſtened.</p>
                     <p>As for that Chronical Icteritious Diſpoſition, no one can think it ſtrange, when this great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of the ſeparation of the Bile is quite deprived of its Natural laxity, if by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:59580:171"/>
and compreſſion of its Subſtance fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing thereupon it is rendred unfit for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of its Function; to wit, the ſecretion of the bilious parts from the Blood, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning of them into the Bile-duct, and Gall-bladder for great uſes, for which they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Nature: From whence there muſt neceſſarily follow too great a congeſtion, or heaping up of Bile in the Blood it ſelf, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon alſo a yellowiſh Tincture of the Skin, an Urine very high-colour'd, yellow, and full of Contents, ſomewhat a whitiſh colour of their Stools, together with a Faintneſs, Weakneſs, and the other uſual Symptoms of a Jaundies.</p>
                     <p>And it may be from this compreſſion of the Subſtance of the Liver, and the varication of the <hi>Vena Portae</hi> cauſed thereby, it happened that the Lymphatick Veſſels which ariſe from the Liver, or the conglobate Glands ſeated in the <hi>Sinus</hi> of it, juſt at the entrance of the <hi>Vena Portae,</hi> were broken; from whence alſo it is eaſie to give the reaſon of that Dropſical Swelling, which came upon this Patient about the end of his Icteritious Conſumption, as it uſes to happen to almoſt all others that are affected in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                     <p>Finally, as for that horrid pain, which is wont to accompany this Diſtemper, we muſt obſerve that every Jaundies, of what ſort ſoever it is, whether Accidental or Habitual, has always this kind of Spaſmodick pain joyned with it; but with this difference, that as an Accidental Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies proceeds meerly from an Obſtruction of the <hi>Porus Bilarius,</hi> or the <hi>Ductus Communis,</hi> cauſed by a ſtone, or the glutinouſneſs of the Bile; ſo it cauſes a very Acute Diſeaſe attended with a dangerous Fever, and dreadful Spaſmodick pains,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:59580:172"/>
even ſo great as to make them ſwoon; which pain indeed is wont nevertheleſs to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the Region of the Stomack, and by the Shoulder-blades, like a Colick of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack: Becauſe theſe Parts that are near are wont to have very painful Spaſms by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent they have with that tender Duct, which at this time is diſtended much beyond is Natural Tone by the Bile, or by Stones: When on the contrary, in an Habitual Jaundies, though there is always felt from the very beginning of the Diſeaſe a certain dull and gravative pain in the Region of the Liver (as I remember it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened often to Mrs. <hi>James,</hi> and ſome others;) to wit, as ſoon as the ſubſtance of this Entrail begins to be deprived of its Natural laxity, and to be too compact. Yet there is no Acute and Spaſmodick pain like the former but only in the parts of the Belly below the Navel, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a true Colick; or in the Region of the Loyns in the form of a Nephritick pain, and that not long before they dye, that is not long before the Liver it ſelf happens at length to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring'd to ſuch a degree from the compreſſion of its Subſtance being much increaſed, that the Blood can very difficultly if at all paſs through it out of the <hi>Vena Portae:</hi> Whereupon who can wonder if the very Veſſels being once diſtended beyond their Natural Tone by the preſſure of the ſubſequent Blood, do by degrees grow very large, if it is not prevented by an immoderate flux of the internal Haemorrhoids (to which this ſort of Patients are very ſubject) or by ſome other Rupture, or elſe opening of the Veſſels. So <hi>Veſſalius,</hi> in the 15th. Chapter of the Fifth Book, obſerved in one that had the Jaundies, and was carried off with the flowing of the Haemorrhoids,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:59580:172"/>
the Liver very much ſwelled, and the branch of the <hi>Vena Portae</hi> all along the Duct of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtinum Rectum</hi> enlarged ſo as to be an Inch in Diameter. Likewiſe <hi>Guarinonius</hi> in 584th. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation affirms, That in Hypochondriacal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons he himſelf has often found the obſtructed Veins of the Meſentery ſo much dilated, that they looked more like Inteſtines than Veins. 'Tis true indeed, this pain is not perceived in the Veſſels themſelves, that are preternaturally diſtended or ſwelled; for the Veins and Arteries (as <hi>Gallen,</hi> in the xij. Chapt. of his Firſt Book of the uſe of the Parts, affirms) have no ſenſe if they are cut, or burnt, or tyed hard with ſtrings. To which Opinion I very readily aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as being perſwaded of the truth of it from the frequent Obſervation of <hi>Varices,</hi> which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to have often happened in Cancrous Breaſts, and in the Legs of Women with Child: All which ſeemed to be affected with a very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſe or no pain from theſe <hi>Varices,</hi> though they were grown never ſo big; which pain too al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſeemed to me to proceed rather from a preternatural diſtention of the external Skin, and a preſſing upon the Muſcular fleſh under them cauſed by the larger <hi>Varices,</hi> than from the ſenſe of the Veſſels themſelves, that were ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricous. And it may be that dreadful pain in the lower part of the Belly, which is wont to accompany an Icterical Conſumption, of which we are now ſpeaking, may be thought to be cauſed in the ſame manner. For as ſoon as the ſubſtance of the Liver happens to be ſo conſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and thickned, that being now deprived of its Natural laxity, it does very difficultly, if at all admit the paſſage of the Blood through it; the <hi>Vena Portae,</hi> and the branches of it, which
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:59580:173"/>
bring the Blood back to this part, muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily at length be much ſwelled, and rendred varicous by the continual drift of freſh Blood, by reaſon of the ſtop that is here put to it. Which being ſo, though the Veins themſelves, according to <hi>Galen</hi>'s Opinion, are not affected with any dolorifick ſenſe, yet none ought to think it ſtrange that from a diſtention, and a <hi>Solutio continui</hi> made in the Membranes, through which theſe varicous Veſſels creep, there proceeds this dreadful and ſpaſmodick pain, which can be removed only with the uſe of <hi>Chalybeate</hi> and Diuretick Medicines, endued with ſubtle and penetrating parts; and that a long and conſtant uſe of them, which may be ſufficient to open the Obſtructions of the Liver. Which Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions being once removed, and thereupon the <hi>Varices</hi> going down of their own accord, the Membranes, through which they creep, may by knitting together again be quickly freed from this Spaſmodick Pain. And in vain, even for the abating of the pain, are outward and warm applications made, to wit, of Fomentations, and Anodyne Liniments, which are wont to be of very great uſe in Pleuritick, Colick, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spaſmodick Pains, becauſe the Blood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the <hi>Varices</hi> is more agitated and heated by external warmth; whereupon a greater va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rication or preternatural diſtention of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels with an increaſe of the pain muſt neceſſarily follow. But I have obſerved that <hi>Oxycrate,</hi> the <hi>Cerote of Saunders, Oyntment of Roſes,</hi> and other ſuch-like Styptick and cooling things, and thoſe applyed cold, have much better anſwered the end. But above all things, <hi>Opium</hi> given inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as it is the laſt, ſo it is likewiſe the only, at leaſt the greateſt Relief and Refuge for this pain.
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:59580:173"/>
This too is given in vain if it be in a little quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity. For no Doſe will truly anſwer our end, unleſs it be ſo great as may be able to cauſe ſome kind of numbneſs or inſenſibility in the diſtended Membranes as well as in the other parts of the Body. Which I have often found in Mr. <hi>Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,</hi> and other Patients in the like caſe; whoſe Pains I could not ſo much as abate, even with <hi>Laudanum</hi> it ſelf, till I began to preſcribe three or four Grains every time. 'Tis true indeed the Original Diſeaſe, and theſe Symptomatical Pains proceeding from it, do afford different Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For as much as theſe Pains are abated by Opiates, ſo much the Obſtruction, or Conſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Subſtance of the Liver, which gave the firſt occaſion of the pain, is increaſed and confirmed. And indeed what is done by <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeates</hi> in the Day-time, is in ſome meaſure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by <hi>Opiates</hi> in the Night. However, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Vital Indication requires it, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and languiſhing Nature muſt be ſupported with neceſſary <hi>Opiates.</hi> For they being now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ready to expire with the continual Fatigue of theſe Spaſms, there cannot be room to uſe either <hi>Chalybeates,</hi> or any other kind of conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Medicines. And therefore in this caſe, though the uſe of <hi>Opium,</hi> which is very neceſſary (and which ought to be compenſated with the more diligent, and longer uſe of Deobſtruent and Attenuating Medicines) may be permitted at due intervals by a Prudent Phyſician, yet we muſt not give even the leaſt Grain of <hi>Laudanum</hi> without urgent neceſſity, becauſe the Original Diſtemper does plainly contraindicate the uſe of it.</p>

                     <p>The Wife of Mr. <hi>Preſtbury,</hi> that lived in <hi>Black-Fryars,</hi> who was now ſome Months gone with Child, really an honeſt Woman, but ſomewhat anxious and thoughtful, at length from Cares, and various Paſſions of her Mind fell into the Jaundies from a deficient ſecretion of the Bile, cauſed by as it were a kind of Schirrous hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and cloſeneſs of the Subſtance of the Liver it ſelf. But from the long neglecting of her Jaundies ſhe became not only tabid and emaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by the long ſubſtraction of the Nutritious Juice; but likewiſe began to want an Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, to have a Thirſt, and ſomething of a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick heat, to be troubled with a difficulty of Breathing, a Cough, and other ſigns of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipient Conſumption of the Lungs; inſomuch that even I my ſelf thought ſhe would in a ſhort time dye of a Conſumption, unleſs there could be ſome help given her to open the Obſtructions of her Liver time enough: And therefore when for fear of a Miſcarriage, I dare order neither <hi>Tinctura Sacra,</hi> nor the Purging Mineral Waters, nor any other Purging Medicine, on the third day of <hi>May</hi> this preſent Year I ordered four Ounces of the Aperitive Apozem already deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to be given her every ſixth hour for ten days together, adding likewiſe twice a day an Ounce of the <hi>Chalyheate</hi> Wine to the Draught. But when by reaſon of ſome Natural Antipathy which ſhe had againſt Saffron, ſhe could neither bear that, not Turmerick-Roots, nor it may be ſome other things that were Ingredients in theſe Medicines, but as ſoon as they were taken ſhe threw them up again, and that not without ſigns

                        <hi>Take the Roots of Succory, Graſs, Parſley, Fennel, Aſparagus, of each two Ounces, of the inner Bark of the Barberry-tree an Ounce, ſhavings of Hartſhorn, Ivory, of each half an Ounce, of Currans two Ounces, boyl them in a ſufficient quantity of Spring-water to a Pint and half, adding when they are almoſt boyled half a Pint of White-wine. To the Liquor when it is ſtrained add the Magiſterial Water of Earth-worms, Syrup of Hedg-Muſtard, of each three Ounces, the Juice of one Lemon.</hi> Mix them, and make an <hi>Apozeme.</hi>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of a Conſumption of the Lungs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from Internal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers of the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and Membranous Parts.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>I Have, as well from Reaſon as Experience, proved in the Firſt Book, that there is a Flame kindled in the ſolid Parts, from the long and plentiful ſubſtraction of the Nutritious Juice cauſed by old and large Ulcers, which are wont to diſcharge continually a great quantity of gleety Matter in what part ſoever of the Body they happen to be ſeated, whether inward or outward, and thereupon the Patient is rendred Tabid. I have likewiſe ſufficiently ſhewn in the 8th. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this Book, that a Conſumption of the Lungs is very often occaſioned from the healing of this kind of Ulcers, but eſpecially if they have been cuſtomary, and of a long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or elſe Malignant, or Fiſtulous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">A true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the Lungs often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from Internal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</note>But becauſe I have obſerved, not only that Patients being brought into the ſtate of an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal <hi>Atrophy,</hi> have at length been rendred Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, but have likewiſe many times from thence been affected with a Conſumption of the Lungs from the beginning by a long continuance of Ulcers bred in the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and Internal Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous Parts, but eſpecially in thoſe, that are reckoned the more Noble, and of greater uſe; ſuch as the Liver, Kidneys, Teſticles, Ovaries, the Womb, and the <hi>Vagina Uteri,</hi> the Urinary
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:59580:175"/>
Bladder, Stomack, Inteſtines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from long ſubſtraction of the Nutritious Juice, as frequently as from the healing of them; I ſhall think fit in this place to add alſo, though briefly, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, which my Practice has offered to me, concerning the peculiar Nature of this kind of Conſumption.</p>
                  <p>Neither has any one reaſon to think it ſtrange;<note place="margin">This is not ſtrange upon ſeveral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations.</note> that this kind of Ulcers, eſpecially if they have been Chronical, can occaſion a true Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lungs: I ſay, no one has reaſon to think it ſtrange, that ſeriouſly conſiders with himſelf how great and continual an expence there is of the Nutritious Juice, that is wont to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd by this kind of Ulcers; and how great an impoveriſhment of the whole Maſs of Blood, together with an Acrimony following upon it, from this ſubſtraction of the Chyle that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the reparation of it; and how great a waſting, or <hi>Atrophy</hi> of the Parts proceeding from thence; thereupon how great an excan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcence or inteſtine motion of the Blood and Spirits, and finally, how great a Flame there is, with a fixt heat in the whole Habit of the Body, together with an Univerſal Colliquation of the Nutritious Juice from the Maſs of Blood (to which by reaſon of its preternatural Heat and Acrimony it could not be perfectly united) made by every Avenue, where it has the liberty of paſſing. But to be Ingenious, and to ſpeak the whole truth, I have been ready to wonder rather that in this Univerſal Flame and Colliquation, the Lungs (whoſe Subſtance is Naturally ſo Tender, Veſiculous, and Spongy, and thereupon as it is apt to be very ſoon affected with a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Heat, ſo it is alſo ready to be as ſoon cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the purulent Particles, which are tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:59580:176"/>
thither by the Circulation of the Blood, and in every conſiderable Colliquation more ſuſceptive of the Humours, than any other part) can ever be long free from a touch of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.<note place="margin">A Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in parts remote from the heart ends in an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer of the Lungs.</note> And indeed to ſpeak the truth of this caſe, whenever theſe Ulcers happen to be bred in the Bladder, Womb, <hi>Vagina Uteri,</hi> the Ovaries, or Kidneys, or other Entrails, or Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous Parts, that are remote from the Heart, and ſo of leſs note, as I have always obſerved the Conſumption that is cauſed by them, to be more Chronical; ſo I have obſerved that a little before Death it certainly terminates in a true Conſumption of the Lungs, proceeding by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees from a ſtuffing of the Lungs to Tubercles, and thoſe ſuch as at length become ripe, and ulcerate, together with a troubleſom Cough, a ſhortneſs of Breath, an univerſal Colliquation, and the other ſigns of this Fatal Diſeaſe.<note place="margin">In a Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption from <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers in the Liver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Death pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents this.</note> But yet in a more Acute and haſty Conſumption, proceeding from an Exulceration of the Liver, Stomack, and other Entrails, or Membranous Parts ſeated nearer to the Heart it ſelf, I have found in the Bodies of ſuch Perſons, that have been opened when they have been dead, the Lungs not ſo much exulcerated, as diſcolour'd, ſtufft, and ſticking to the ſides of the Cavity of the Breaſt; and at length (that is, when they have been very ill affected) full of crude Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bercles: Becauſe by reaſon they dyed quickly, there was not time enough for the Lungs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any deep impreſſions from this Phthiſical Malignity; the Patient being taken off by a quick Death from the Original Conſumption be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Tubercles of the Lungs could be ripen'd, or the Conſumption of the Lungs could be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced beyond its firſt or ſecond degree. But
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:59580:176"/>
in this very Acute Conſumption I have found plainly the ſame, if not more violent Symptoms, than in a true Pulmonary Conſumption that has been Mortal; the ſame fierce and troubleſome Cough, the ſame difficulty of Breathing, though they proceeded meerly from a ſtuffing of the Lungs, and crude Tubercles bred in them; but firſt an Inflammatory Fever, and afterwards a Putrid and Intermitting Fever, attended with an Univerſal Colliquation, Light-headedneſs, and other more direful and fatal Symptoms than in an Original Conſumption of the Lungs; I ſpeak of thoſe which ariſe from an Inflammation and Exulceration of the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> or Membranous Parts, that are very Noble. So that it is a very hard matter to diſtinguiſh this Conſumption from an Original Conſumption of the Lungs, unleſs it be by the more intenſe degree of the Symptoms, and by ſome Pathognomonick ſigns, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Part that is primarily affected.</p>
                  <p>Every Pulmonary Conſumption of this ſort is very hard to Cure,<note place="margin">Theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions are very hard to Cure.</note> becauſe it ſprings from a certain Fountain, that is for ever running. For the Internal Ulcers, which gave the firſt Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to this Conſumption, can very ſeldom be perfectly cured, as lying beyond the Sphere of Surgery.<note place="margin">And not to be cured without heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer.</note> And indeed to Cure this Conſumption perfectly, without healing of the Ulcers, from from which it takes its Original, is the ſame thing as to take away an Effect whilſt the Cauſe of that Effect remains. It is true indeed that ſo often as theſe Ulcers happen to be ſmall and benign, and are likewiſe placed in the Kidneys, Bladder, Teſticles, Ovaries, the <hi>Vagina Uteri,</hi> or in other Membranous Parts and Entrails, that are more remote from the Heart; as the Ulcers themſelves (which here aſſume the Nature of a Cauſe)
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:59580:177"/>
do ſometimes admit of a perfect Cure, ſo likewiſe the Pulmonary Conſumption it ſelf, which depends upon them, may as well be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But this Conſumption, whether it be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a Cure or not, does nevertheleſs almoſt always aſſume the Nature of a Chronical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe in ſome meaſure. And from hence I have found ſome of this ſort of Patients for ſeveral Months,<note place="margin">When this Conſumption is Chronical.</note> yea, and ſometim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſeveral Years lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing with a Conſumption, pining away by degrees, and diſſolv'd by Colliquations; but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when the ſource of the Diſeaſe has been in one of the Kidneys, the Bladder, or <hi>Vagina Uteri,</hi> that have been ulcerated. A Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proceeding from an Ulcer of the Ovaries in Women, or the Teſticles in Men, I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to have been of a middle Nature, but for the moſt part to carry off the Patient within the ſpace of a Year: But that which ariſes from an Exulceration of the Womb it ſelf,<note place="margin">When Acute.</note> the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, Liver, or other Entrails, or Membranous Parts of the greateſt note, I have obſerved to put an end to the Patient's Life in the ſpace of a very few Months, or even Weeks, after the manner of a very Acute Conſumption; becauſe it has been immediately attended, firſt, with an extraordinary Inflammatory Fever, and after that with a Putrid Intermitting Fever, and an univerſal Colliquation, together with a want of Reſt, Light-headedneſs, Spaſms, and other dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Symptoms of the Nerves. But yet by reaſon of the ſudden Deſtruction brought on from the Nature of the Original Diſeaſe, I have found by inſpecting into Bodies after they have been dead, that the Lungs have not been ſo much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, as they uſed to be in other Conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that are more Chronical; to wit, where by
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:59580:177"/>
reaſon that the Original Diſtemper has ſuffered the Patient to live long enough, the Lungs have happen'd not only to be ſtufft, but likewiſe to have Tubercles bred in them, and thoſe Tuber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles at length have happen'd to turn to Apoſtems. But, generally ſpeaking,<note place="margin">The more Acute it is, the harder to Cure.</note> as every Conſumption of this kind is very hard to Cure, ſo it is ſo much the harder as it is more Acute, becauſe it has its Original from more conſiderable Ulcers. Neither indeed does it ever admit of a perfect Cure without the healing of the Ulcers what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are, and in whatſoever Entrail or Membranous Part thoſe Ulcers are bred, which gave the firſt occaſion to this Diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>From what I have now ſaid, it is plain enough even to Reaſon what are the Indications of Cure in this kind of Conſumptions, which likewiſe the happy Succeſs of our Practice is wont daily to preſent to our very ſight; that is, whenever the Diſtemper does in its own Nature admit of a Cure.<note place="margin">The Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Cure</note> And they muſt reſpect the Original Diſeaſe as well as the Lungs themſelves, firſt, by promoting as much as we can the healing of the Ulcers, in what part ſoever of the Body they have been bred, with the plentiful uſe of Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamick and Vulnerary Medicines; which indeed ought to be of the milder ſort, leſt by increaſing the Feveriſh Flame, that is already kindled in the Blood, they ſhould do more hurt than good.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by taking timely care of the Lungs with the uſe of Pulmonary Remedies, to wit, Opiate and Expectorating Medicines given al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately; by which the miſchief which they have got, may be taken off, or at leaſt as little as may be promoted by the Original Diſtemper.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, by mixing always with the Pectoral and Balſamick Medicines thoſe things which
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:59580:178"/>
may reſtore and confirm the Tone of the Part, which was firſt of all affected, and which have a particular reſpect to it; as <hi>Uterines, Hepaticks, Diureticks,</hi> and other ſuch-like Medicines, as the caſe may require.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, by tempering the Hectick heat, which is already kindled in the Blood and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, with a ſtrict Milk Diet, the <hi>Chalybeate</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Waters, Vulnerary Decoctions of <hi>Sarſa,</hi> Lime-water, and other things of the like Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (ſo far as the preſent ſtate of the Patient can bear them;) as alſo by taking off the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid Intermitting Fever with the plentiful uſe of the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Bark, and with repeating of it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten enough at due intervals: And laſtly, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving with the moſt diligent application the moſt urgent Symptoms, and thoſe which weaken the Patient moſt, whether they ariſe from the Original Ulcer, or from the Lungs. As for Example.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Method of Cure.</note>If the Original Ulcer is ſo benign and ſmall, that there appear any hopes of a perfect Cure, and it has not continued ſo long, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is brought very weak with it; and if it is not ſeated in ſo Noble a Part, as to make us fear the ſudden deſtruction of the Perſon from an Acute Conſumption, it is plainly convenient in the very beginning of the Cure to endeavour the healing of the Original Ulcer, by giving <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomelanos</hi> plentifully, and that not only mixt with Purges, and therefore at due intervals, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by it ſelf in Doſes repeated quickly one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the other, with a deſign to raiſe a Salivation; by which (if the Patient has ſtrength enough to bear ſo great an Evacuation, and it be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient in other reſpects) we ſhall take much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Meaſures, as for the healing of the Ulcer, ſo
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:59580:178"/>
likewiſe for the preventing of the Conſumption, which is like to follow, than by any other <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratus</hi> of Medicines.</p>
                  <p>But if that be contraindicated by the Patient's Weakneſs, the intenſe degree of the Fever, and the very Acute Nature of the Conſumption, at leaſt as Antimonial, ſo Mercurial Medicines may be ſo diſpoſed at due intervals in the Method of Cure, that they may ſucceſsfully exert their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Healing Vertue without any expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Evacuation excited thereby. As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: Let the Patient take every Night xv. or xx. Grains of <hi>Antimonium Diaphoreticum</hi> in a little bit of Old Conſerve of Red Roſes mixt with <hi>Leucatellus</hi>'s Balſam. And every third or fourth Morning a Scruple, or half a Dram of <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Dulcis</hi> in a ſpoonful of Milk.</p>
                  <p>Let him alſo drink a Vulnerary Decoction of <hi>Sarſa,</hi> deſcribed in another place, for his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Drink, adding always at the time when he takes it, of the Balſamick Syrup ſo much as will ſerve to make a Draught of it grateful to the Patient's Palate.</p>
                  <p>My Balſamick Pills are likewiſe very good in this caſe, being ordered ſo that the Patient may take three of them every day at Phyſical hours; drinking after them four or ſix Ounces of the <hi>Traumatick</hi> Decoction, and the Pectoral Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction mixt in equal quantities. Here likewiſe it is very convenient to temper the Hectical heat of the Blood with a Milk Diet ordered in the ſtricteſt manner, or elſe (if other things do not contradict, and it is a proper time of the Year for it) with a long uſe of the <hi>Chalybeate</hi> Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Waters, the Vertue of which, eſpecially in curing a Conſumption proceeding from an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulceration of the Kidneys and Bladder, I have
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:59580:179"/>
often tryed with good Succeſs. Neither is it of leſs uſe, as well to temper the Acrimony, and heat of the Blood, as to carry down the load of Purulent and Heterogeneous Particles heaped up in the Maſs of Blood, to give at Phyſical hours an Emulſion made of fifty or ſixty Wood-lice, and four Ounces of the Vulnerary Decoction of <hi>Sarſa</hi> ſweetned with the Balſamick Syrup; or with two Ounces of the Pectoral Decoction, and as much of the <hi>Traumatick</hi> Decoction.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Peruvian</hi> Bark is likewiſe of very great Efficacy in this caſe to relieve the Putrid Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Fever, cauſed by the mixture of the Purulent and Heterogeneous Particles, that are ſent into the Maſs of Blood from the Original Ulcer. Which we muſt repeat often at due in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals for this end, thereby to obtain ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite, as well to ſupport and relieve languiſhing Nature, as for the uſe of Balſamick Medicines, and other things of that Nature, which reſpect the Original Diſtemper.</p>

From which he was freed I know not by what means; yet he continued free from the return of any ſuch kind of Fit till he was almoſt Forty Years old, and the Year 1670. From which time almoſt for the full ſpace of Ten Years, to wit, to his
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:59580:179"/>
dying day, he uſed oftentimes in a Year to be taken with, and to be a long time ill of this dreadful Diſtemper, with a violent pain in his Side, a high Fever, and other uſual Symptoms from any violent Motion, the taking of Cold, a draught of Sack, or any other the leaſt occaſion. But when I was firſt called to go ſee him, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaking the Diſtemper for a Pleuriſie, I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured in vain to free him from his painful Spaſms with repeated Bleeding, a Fomentation, and Anodyne Liniments, as alſo with Pectoral Medicines; till at length upon a more attentive Inſpection, and Obſervation, as well of his high-colour'd and yellowiſh Urine, as of his whitiſh Stools, and of his Skin being lightly ting'd with a Jaundies colour, I reaſonably altered my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and upon that I took off the Racking Fit with the repeated uſe of the <hi>Tinctura Sacra,</hi> given with Liquid <hi>Laudanum</hi> at the time of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Reſt, and of the Purging Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters boyl'd, and turn'd with Milk, given him to take the following Mornings. And in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I uſed afterwards to take it off eaſily, and that in a little time. But though his Fits were by this means brought to be ſhorter, yet with the frequent return of them (becauſe ſo long as this Spaſmodick Conſtriction continued upon the Bile-duct, which was at the ſame time plugg'd up with a Stone, the uſual Excretion, or Paſſage of the Bile into the Inteſtines being thereby hindred, and ſo the Nutritious part of the Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being driven down into the thick Guts with the Excrements, there was very little if any thing ſupplyed for the reparation of the Blood.) I ſay, with the frequent return of theſe Fits, the Patient did by degrees continually waſt away from the detraction of the due Nutritious
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:59580:180"/>
Juice, having likewiſe Tremblings come upon him, and Spaſms in the Nervous Parts frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recurring. Which I now obſerving, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ſudden Deſtruction of Nature, amongſt other things I ordered the uſe of <hi>Chalybeate</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, but eſpecially the <hi>Vitriolick</hi> Waters every Year, from which I hoped there would follow the opening of the Obſtructions, and the reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Tone of the Liver, which was much ſpoyl'd. But at length, to wit, about the Year 1680. my Patient being taken with a moſt violent Colick, together with an Inflammatory Fever, though he was treated with Bleeding, and a due Regimen, yet at laſt his Fever turning into a Putrid Intermitting Fever, which was a <hi>Quotidian,</hi> notwithſtanding the uſe of the <hi>Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi> Bark, Pectoral Medicines, and Temperate Juleps, and likewiſe the application of Bliſters, and the giving of other things, which either I or my Famous Colleague Dr. <hi>Pagett</hi> thought might be moſt Efficacious, this Excellent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon within the ſpace of ſix Weeks dyed deeply Conſumptive, being delirous in his Fever-Fits, and always miſerably troubled with an Aſthma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Cough, in the ſame manner as thoſe that are affected with a true Pulmonary Conſumption, and likewiſe worn to nothing with an univerſal Colliquation. The Body being opened when he was dead, we found the Gall-bladder very much diſtended like a Purſe with Stones of a different Magnitude without even the leaſt drop of Bile in it. Likewiſe in the Concave part of the Liver, juſt at the entrance of the <hi>Vena Portae</hi> was found a large Apoſteme, which contained in it almoſt a Pint of true <hi>Pus.</hi> But for all his great Cough, and difficulty of Breathing, we did not find the Lungs affected with any Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bercles,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:59580:180"/>
at leaſt that were maturated, though we found them ting'd with ſeveral colours, and ſtufft, and adhering to the ſides of the Breaſt.</p>
                     <p>Whereupon the Colick of his Stomack, which frequently returned, ſeemed to me to have its Original from the moving of the Stones out of the Gall-bladder: The Univerſal, and Habitual Conſumption from the frequent Obſtruction of the Bile cauſed by that Colick; the fatal Fever, which was firſt Inflammatory, and afterwards Putrid and Intermitting, together with the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Colliquation, and <hi>Maraſmus</hi> following upon it from the Inflammation and Exulceration of the Liver; finally, the Cough and difficulty of Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from a more light Symptomatical Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Lungs; but ſuch as by reaſon of the haſty and acute Nature of the Original Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe (however that dreadful Cough ſeemed to be Aſthmatical) was not advanced beyond the firſt degree of a Pulmonary Conſumption.</p>

                     <p>The Wife of Mr. <hi>Greaves,</hi> living in <hi>Paſter-Noſter-Row,</hi> who, when ſhe was a Virgin uſed to be very Cachectical, a few Months after ſhe was married, and before the Twentieth Year of her Age, began to be Melancholy, and to have Oppreſſions at her Breaſt: Her Belly likewiſe ſwell'd, but yet more on one ſide than on the other: Her Appetite was plainly loſt, her Thirſt increaſed, and a Conſumption together with a Hectick Fever at length prevailed ſo much upon her, that having at length wholly given over the vain hopes of being with Child, I was ſent for, though too late, to viſit this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Patient: Whom I found in a Tabid ſtate,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:59580:181"/>
and afflicted every day with a Putrid Intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Fever, which moreover was accompanyed with the Gripes, vaſt Colliquative Sweats, a Dropſical Swelling of the Legs as well as of the Belly, a perpetual Catarrhous Cough, a ſhortneſs of Breath, and the other uſual Symptoms of a Fatal Conſumption of the Lungs. With which the Patient being at length brought into the ſtate of a <hi>Maraſmus</hi> in the ſpace of ſix Weeks or ſomewhat more, notwithſtanding the plentiful uſe of Pulmonary and Uterine Medicines, of the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Bark, <hi>Laudanum,</hi> Pearl Juleps, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicatories, and other Remedies reſpecting the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Diſeaſe as well as the various Symptoms proceeding from it, and ſhe waſting away by degrees, went off plainly in the ſame manner, as thoſe uſe to do, who dye of a Conſumption of the Lungs.</p>
                     <p>The Body being opened after ſhe was dead, we found the Lungs, contrary to our Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not very much affected with the Stigmes of a Conſumption. For though we found them ſtufft, adhering to the Ribs, and ting'd with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Colours, yet (ſo far as I remember) there were no Tubercles, either crude or ripe, found in them: But the Subſtance of one Ovary was plainly eaten away and conſumed by an Exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceration; and the outward Membrane in a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful manner diſtended with a Dropſical Humour, ſo that we took out of it, which now took up the greateſt part of the Belly, ſeveral Pints of Water ſomewhat purulent, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a great quantity of little Bones, and ſmall Fibres, or (as I judg'd) threads which had made up the Glandulous Subſtance that look'd like yellow Hair.</p>

By which Colliquative Fever, as alſo by the ſubſtraction of the Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Juice by the large Dropſical Swelling of the Ovary ſuch a quick Conſumption, and ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous a difficulty of Breathing were cauſed, that her Life being thereby brought all of a ſudden into extream danger, there was not time enough given for that Conſumption which was impreſt upon the Lungs to be advanced beyond the firſt degree of a Pulmonary Conſumption, though there ſeemed to be all the uſual Symptoms of a Fatal Conſumption of the Lungs.</p>

                     <p>A certain Merchant of <hi>London</hi> before the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth Year of his Age (when he had now lived almoſt two Years ſomewhat ſickly, and with little and uncertain Appetite, which perhaps he procured to himſelf by his immoderate uſe of Wine and Women) at length asked my Advice about a Swelling, and a painful Inflammation ariſing from thence, with which the right Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticle had been now affected for almoſt the ſpace of three Months, and that (as he told me) oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by ſome Contuſion he had got in Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Indeed that Swelling to me ſeemed to be a kind of <hi>Sarcocele.</hi> The Teſticle ſwell'd to the bigneſs of ones fiſt. There was likewiſe no
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:59580:182"/>
ſmall Inflammation upon the <hi>Scrotum</hi> it ſelf, as well as upon the Teſticle. But with repeated Bleedings, the application of Cataplaſms made of Barley-meal and Oxycrate (the Parts affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted being likewiſe kept up with a Truſs to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the flux of Humours into the place) fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Purging with <hi>Calomelanos</hi> and <hi>Confectio Hamech,</hi> and alſo drinking plentifully of Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the four greater cold Seeds made with Barley-water, and of a Decoction of <hi>Sarſa</hi> and <hi>China</hi> ordered for his common Drink, the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Inflammation plainly vaniſh'd. But the Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſtill continued, though without any pain, and the bigneſs of it was uncertain, being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times greater, ſometimes leſs, and eaſily yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a preſſure of ones fingers; ſo that at length the Judgment of two very skilful Surgeons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken, and that Swelling being ſuppoſed to be a <hi>Hydrocele,</hi> it was juſtly thought fit to open it. But when it was ſolemnly opened with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion-Knife, there came out ſcarce any Water, and no Matter. Alſo the whole Subſtance of the Teſticle ſeemed to have been eaten away, and periſh'd for ſome time, but the Inveſting Coats were hard and incraſſated, ſo that the Teſticle being once opened look'd like an empty Egg-ſhell, or rather a Pomegranate-ſhell, when the Meat, or that which was contained in it, is taken out. From the Fiſtulous ſtate of this Swelling it came to paſs that the Surgeons being deceived, and taking it, becauſe it yielded to the preſſure of their Fingers, for a <hi>Hydrocele,</hi> opened it by Inciſion, though indeed after they had once opened it, it ſoon appeared to be in truth a Venereal Fiſtula, proceeding from ſome virulent and old <hi>Gonorrhoea,</hi> that had been ill cured. But from that Wound there aroſe a
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:59580:182"/>
large Ulcer, which every day ran a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Ichorous, or gleety Matter. Which though many times it deluded us for ſeveral times with the vain hopes of Curing it, having ordered the <hi>Sarſa</hi> Drink now again for his ordinary Drink, when at the ſame time he was purged with the bitter Decoction repeated at due intervals, that is, ſo often as there was occaſion, and every Night he had a <hi>Paregorick</hi> Draught given him with Syrup of <hi>Diacodium.</hi> But yet from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected flux of the Humours, (which (as I always told the Surgeons) it was impoſſible to prevent without caſtration or cutting out of the Fiſtulous Teſticle) the Ulcer very often broke out again; ſo that the Patient being quickly brought into a Tabid and Hectick ſtate by the contiual and plentiful ſubſtraction of the Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Juice through the Wound, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences ariſing from it, which Nature was not able to bear, as he began to have a great Thirſt, ſo likewiſe to loſe his Stomack, and at length to be afflicted with a troubleſome Cough, a ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Breath, and the other uſual Symptoms of the Lungs when they are diſtemper'd; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually waſting away more and more with the ſudden Ruin of Nature, which was much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by the Fits of a Putrid Intermitting Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver coming upon all; which returned every day at a ſtated hour with a Chilneſs, Heat, and Sweats ſucceeding one another; till at length the Patient being brought to the utmoſt degree of a <hi>Maraſmus,</hi> was forced to yield to Fate.</p>
                     <p>With the repeated uſe of the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Bark I very often took off his Putrid Fever, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs (the cauſe of it ſtill remaining in the Wound) returned as often, after the interval of a Week or two. Likewiſe the Hectick heat,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:59580:183"/>
which was kindled in his Blood, was much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated with the uſe of a Milk Diet, of Aſſes Milk, and by the benefit of the open Country Air; though it could never be perfectly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, becauſe the Procatartick Cauſe of it, to wit, the Malignant and Incurable Ulcer was plainly too much for the Art of Surgery. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon at laſt, the ulcerated part being gangren'd, after he had lain ſix Months, he was reduced to a very Skeleton, and carryed off not only with an Univerſal Conſumption, but alſo a true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the Lungs, though it was a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomatical one.</p>

<pb n="357" facs="tcp:59580:183"/>
of the Lungs; at length he ſent for me, though 'twas to no purpoſe. For I found him Sick in Bed, in the laſt degree of a Symptoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Conſumption of the Lungs, which as it was in its own Nature fatal, ſo likewiſe very quick. And therefore when I had once given him my helping Hand as much as I could for the Relief of the urgent Symptoms, I preſently took my leave of him, having firſt made a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnoſtick of his Death.</p>
                     <p>Neither indeed did this miſerable Patient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue many days. But not having the liberty of opening the Body after he was dead, though there were all the Symptoms of a Pulmonary Conſumption, yet as it did not appear to me as an Eye-witneſs, ſo I cannot confidently affirm how much the Lungs themſelves had happened to be affected and injured thereby.</p>

                     <p>A certain Old Gentlewoman, a Lawyer's Wife, that lived in <hi>Shoe-Lane,</hi> when (as ſhe told me) ſhe had for the ſpace of Twenty Years been hardly able to ſleep half an hour at a time by reaſon of a violent and continual pain in making of Water; with which, and with other direful Symptoms accompanying of it ſhe having been very much and continually weakned (and that notwithſtanding ſhe had taken the Advice of the moſt able Phyſicians) and thereupon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought at length into a plain Conſumptive and Hectick ſtate, and being continually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to her Bed by reaſon of her Weakneſs, ſhe ſent for me not long before ſhe dyed; now when by reaſon of the loſs of her Appetite, ſhe had for a long time abhorred Food as well as Phyſick
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:59580:184"/>
When I came I found her really an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Woman, that adorn'd her Old Age with Fortitude and Prudence beyond what is common to that Sex; but yet (as I gueſt even at the firſt ſight by her extream Emaciation, Cough, Fever, and difficulty of Breathing) I found her lying very miſerably in the laſt degree of a Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Becauſe ſhe was obliged almoſt perpetually to conflict not only with the uſual Symptoms of a Pulmonary Conſumption, and a Hectick Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but alſo with a frequent and dreadful Spaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modick Colick of her Stomack, from the motion of ſome Stones out of the Gall-Bladder, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with a continual pain in making of Water, cauſed by a Stone, and an Ulcer of the Kidneys. From whence it came to paſs, that her Urine when 'twas firſt made, was whitiſh, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards had a very great, a fetid, and truly puru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Sediment. But upon looking on the Urine, I preſently found there was a pretty large Ulcer cauſed by a Stone in the Kidney affected, and I did think that a Pulmonary Conſumption had been brought on Symptomatically by that Ulcer.</p>
                     <p>Nature having been now for ſome time weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, oppreſt, and ſinking under ſo many, and ſuch great Evils, it happened likewiſe that her Brain, and the whole <hi>Genus Nervoſum</hi> were ſo remarkably and continually affected, that laying aſide all her other Complaints of her Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Ulcer, and Stone, ſhe deſired only this, that I would do ſomething to help her againſt her Swoonings, and Faintneſs, which often returned, as alſo againſt delirouſneſs, and the cold and hot Vapours, (as ſhe called them) which did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually both Night and Day alternately ſucceed each other, which ſeemed to be more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to her than all the other miſerable Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms.
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:59580:184"/>
Preſently I did all I could to relieve thoſe trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Symptoms with the uſe of <hi>Spirit of Hartſhorn,</hi> of <hi>Salt Armoniack, Tincture of Caſtor, Antihyſterick Juleps,</hi> and other things of that Nature. Neither indeed did I plainly neglect her diſtempered Lungs, and her ulcerated Kidneys, (where the firſt Original of this Diſtemper lay) but I took care of theſe too, with the uſe of Emulſions, Balſamick and Pectoral Medicies, that is, ſo far as the extenuated Habit of her Body, and of her bad Stomack would bear. But yet all theſe things were now ordered to no purpoſe. For as the Ulcer of her Kidney was now for a long time become plainly incurable; ſo likewiſe the Secundary Affections of the Lungs and <hi>Genus Nervo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum,</hi> which were the Effects of it, ſeemed to be rather the Trophies of conquer'd and yielding Nature, than either accidental Oppreſſions, or any accidental Diſeaſes, that Art could overcome. But a little before ſhe dyed, when Death ſeemed to be near at hand, this <hi>Virago</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired me very earneſtly, and indeed made me promiſe that I would take care that her Body ſhould be opened after ſhe was dead, that for the good of the Living, ſhe might, when ſhe was dead, be ſerviceable to that Art of Phyſick, from which ſhe received no Benefit whilſt ſhe lived.</p>
                     <p>The Husband having given leave (though with much ado) that the Body ſhould be examined after ſhe was dead, ſhe was opened very Solemnly, ſeveral Eminent Phyſicians being preſent. The firſt thing that was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable was, that though all the Limbs, and the Face of this Tabid Woman were emaciated, yet the Adipoſe Membrane of the Belly was ſtrangely thick with Fat, as it commonly happens to Calculous Perſons, it may be from a ſlower motion of the Blood through the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Parts, and a ſmaller ſecretion of the <hi>Serum</hi> by the Kidneys than there ought to be; but we found the outward Membrane of the left Kidney ſticking firmly to it, as being ſomething ſwelled from its Diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>But the Subſtance of it being opened it looked like a Honey-Comb, being every where full of Stones and Cavities, or certain little Cells, out of which ſome Stones had been formerly extruded, but without the leaſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulceration. But the right Kidney we found like a Purſe
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:59580:185"/>
not only full of Stones and Matter, but likewiſe very much diſtended, the whole Subſtance alſo, which had been contained within the inveſting Membranes, having been before by degrees corrupted and conſumed, and likewiſe the Membranes themſelves being filled with abundance of Stones and Serous <hi>Pus,</hi> ſuch as we like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe found in the Bladder, and ſuch as ſhe uſed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to void with her Urine. From which the cauſe of that Chronical Dyſury and Conſumption, with which ſhe had been ſo long afflicted, was very evident. Alſo the Emulgent Veins, which carryed back the Blood from the Kidneys, by reaſon of the mighty Calculous diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Blood, with which this Miſerable Old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was affected, were (which was very ſtrange) like ſtony Pipes covered on the inſide with a plain calculous Cruſt. Moreover we found the Gall-Bladder full of Stones, from the motion of which that Cholick of her Stomack, accompanyed with dreadful Spaſms, with which ſhe was often troubled, did without doubt take its Original. Yet we did not find that the Lungs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were any where exulcerated, but almoſt every where full of crude Tubercles, and Chalky Stones. From which the cauſe of her continual Cough, ſhortneſs of Breath, and the other Pulmonary Affections did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to our very ſight. Yet I do not at all doubt but that in progreſs of time thoſe Tubercles might have ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened; and by that means this Incipient Conſumption of the Lungs might have gone on to a Confirm'd and Deplorable Conſumption, if an untimely Death, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by other cauſes, had not prevented it.</p>
